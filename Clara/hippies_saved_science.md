#### Descriptive Summary
Hippies pushed forawrd the "lost practice" (quotes used for effect, not because I'm quoting Kaiser) of philosophical discussion and the interpretaive work of physics. Exploring wacky philosophical implications, and trying to do interpretive work to figure out how weird physics concepts worked in practice and their strange real-world implications had been something that the early 20th C big-name physicists (Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger etc.) did, but this practice was quashed during the massive expansion and subsequent contration of the field of physics in the postwar period--> a flood of government/military funding flooded physics demanding the training of masses of new physists, then funding was cut drastically (boom and bust of postwar physics). During the boom and bust, the motivation and goals of physics became more shortsighted and focused on measurement (in Kaiser's judgement). 

Anyway, in the narrowed state of American Physics in the late 60s/early 70s, the hippies (he takes the work of the the Fundamental Fysics Group at ?Berkeley? as the emblematic example of this) pushed forward philosophical discussion of physics, and the pursuit of the more "mystical-ish" questions in physics that interested them, forctin attention to be paid to several KEY concepts--noteably Bell's Theorem and Quantum Entanglement-- that had previously been neglected in the bean-counting physics (post funding + resource cutbacks coupled with demands for tangible results)

a fundemental Question i.e. way of framing what makes physics/counterculture bedfellows: Physics really does attract wackos, but many of these wackos (Einstein etc. can be considered in this group according to Kaiser), but how do we separate out who is who?

Kaiser is in favor of: acknowledging the profound importance of philosophical discussion for kickstarting research into bells theorem--and the counter-culture's role in pushing these discussions forward (and funding some of these efforts when no one else would)
And Aginast: the writing out of history of the above^^^ by a hyper-focus on the experimentatal confirmation of the theorem as *the thing that made quantum enganglement*

More attention to the Interpretive work of physics.

1: Shut up and calculate

Ah, the good times when Einstein, Schrodinger and Bohr ribbed at each other lolololol. The disc around the double slit expriment as a case-study illustrating this. 
Then the fall: and transition to "shut up and calculate" mentality

2: "spooky action at a distance"

Hippies like bell's Theorem--> description of that

3: Enganglements 

4: From [symbol for psi] to Psi

a jaunt into parapsychology and etc. and the weird stuff that didn't actually pan out into valid science

5: New Patrons, New Forums

About getting funding success with splashier discussion of physics. Using the philosophical new-agey interpretations of physics to make more people interested... 
Also about getting funding from "weird" sources. Rich new-age types

6: spreading and selling the word

7: Zen and the art of textbook publishing

The publication of pop-physics books. Apparently this was the start of this trend (around 1980ish???)
"The Tao of Physics"

8: Fringe?!

Interplay between groups--showing that the hippy discussion groups were NOT fringe lol. there was movement between these discussion groups, and physics communities--people moving from one group to another and part of both

9: From FLASH to Quantum Encryption

10: The Roads from Berkeley

#### Relevant (analytical/critical) notes
The history in chapter one detailing the boom and bust of american physics in the immediate postwar period is going to be very useful for Q2. 
I like that Kaiser is able to discuss how both the expansion and the contraction had tangible results on both the overall stance of physics research and types of research questions being pursued-->both necessitate a shift towards pragmatism, but for different reasons, it seems:
in expansion: requirements of training masses of new physicists at once necessitates a shift toward away from deeper discussion (vision of lecture halls FULL of graduate students). Routinization of physics education (17)
in contraction: Under increased scrutiny about where funding is going, there are demands for tangible results. Less freedom, resources and human personnel to pursue weird shit.
