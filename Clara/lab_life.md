#### Descriptive Summary


Latour and Wologar's very well-known book that first(?) laid out the foundational ideas that science is also socially constructed--these are the main ideas that will inform a lot of Latour's later work. I really need to buy my own copy ðŸ˜•

I have only read chapter 5, Cycles of credit for this semester's work!

Cycles of credit


Here Latour and Woolgar turn their attention to the work of the scientists that is more oriented towards developing their careers and professional relationships with each other. Scientists look for credit for their work and they try to be as credible as possible to their peers, not as an ends in themselves--scientists aren't paid in reputation either for reliability or for productivity necessarily (the idea of having credibility as a reward is less powerful and interesting to Latour and Woolgar). Scientists seek credit for their work because of the opportunities the reputation for having done good science opens up to them. For example, if a scientist has a good finding and a reputation for having reliable work, it opens up other avenues of research for them in new partnerships with other scientists, grant funding, etc. He analogizes this kind of credit to capital, and conceptualizes this circular effect as the cycle of credit

[picture]
There's also a market "economy of ideas" (206) as ideas themselves are useful currency in science, as ideas might lead to valuable breakthroughs--they are part of the reason why scientists are so careful to cultivate relationships with peers--so that they can gain access to their peers' good ideas!!

In the cycle of credit, scientists can convert credibility from one form to another. because if you have credibility from having done good work with one dataset, had good methods and good findings, you can get access to more datasets, and have more strong relationships with peers. And if you have a grant, you can convert the credibility from receiving the grant into supplies and equipment that make your work seem even more credible. 

Latour does discuss the division between the "idea-havers" (not his term) who are the scientists who are not interchangeable, and the technicians who are interchangeable. Idea-havers are not interchangeable in the lab because they direct the direction of the work, and they have a good reputation for having great ideas that open up new space for experiments, This is where Latour's discussion of position and career trajectory comes in around (211-217) Scientists need to take the best possible position for gaining access to the cycle of credit and so as to become an "idea haver" class of scientist, some scientists will stagnate in a techncian role unfortunately.
