#### Descriptive Summary

Part one: Constructing the System
1: The Nature of Experimental life
Stresses that this book and His approach is about the material culture and the practical methods of experimental scientists involved in the fly work. This is not an intellectual history of fly research. Also talks about the social history of the scientists who work on flies. Orients this work counter to the straight narratives framing the original fly group as founding fathers of a new discipline “A heroic vein.”
Seeks to address following big question: why do some lab organisms become STANDARD, like the standard fly, and flourish as a massive omnipresent standard organism? While many do not. Why the fly in particular…

“I hope to persuade readers of this book that the experimental sciences have been shaped by their material cultures: the the practical imperatives of choosing organisms, constructing tools, and making experiments work” (3)


The development of the fly as a standard organism—a material technology that affords specific types of work and scientific inquiry, and is the basis of a number of lab procedures, and organization. Also interlocks with, futhers, and benefits from particular forms of sociality and modes of collaboration between scientists (kohler says this more elegantly on page 5 “[my aim] is the show how a distinctive workplace culture arose out of the process of constructing a “standard” fly, and how this culture shaped the ways in which the fly was produced” (5)). Kohler is more interested in the processes for producing research, “the material culture, social conventions, and moral ordering of the experimental process”. (3)
Sees flies as BOTH technologically, biologically, and morally—Some important tension exists here, but it’s possible for both at the same time! Sees as technological artefacts as they are embedded in specific technical systems of production for scientific research. “experimental creatures are a special kind of technology in that they are altered environmentally or physically to do things that humans value but that they might not have done in nature” (6)—they are altered to be instruments and react to experiments in very specific ways—at the most extreme, standard animals start to function as a kind of substrate that is experimented upon…but only in very specific contexts, embedded in specific systems. Biological because they are still messy biological organisms with a natural history and ecological relationships with other organisms, even humans as flies are domesticated in the lab. Moral because it’s a way of looking into the kinds of moral economies that are set up in the social and cultural circles of the scientists in the fly group. Moral economy idea is huge and very important for my own research. These moral economies regulate the types of experimental activities the scientists engage in and encourage certain “mutual expectations and obligations” in workplace culture that shape the research. Specific rewards for specific kinds of achievement.

2: Crossing the Threshold
From the Directory: “In selecting the topics I have followed the fly, beginning with the story of how Drosophila found its way into laboratories, and how this wild, highly variable creature was constructed into a standard instrument that could be used for precise, quantitative genetic mapping (Chapters 2 and 3)” (13)
Natural history of the fruit fly and its contact with and eventual domestication by humans. Starts by talking about agriculture and the contact with flies during fruit farming, and goes from there. Argues that to importation into labs is not possible without this pre-existing relationship.
Early work with fruit flies at Indiana university around 1903. Gives short account of a developing network of American experimental zoologists (23)—IU was a node in this network along with University of Chicago, Carnegie etc.
“foraging for organisms” Zoologists wanted to find organisms that best suited their research—specialization in a particular organism established the experimentor some “elbow room” reducing competition in research field. History of biologists domesticating organisms for study, and borrowing pre-domesticated animals holds some advantages, namely that fanciers had already identified and cultivated mutants and distinct strains with special traits…the fly did not have this (31). Fly work picks up as mutants uncovered.
Raises fascinating prospect that part of advantage was that flies were great for student projects, and much each work was cultivated by technicians, and teachers at small teaching colleges—drawing on the large numbers of people with higher education who were otherwise shut out of traditional science!! In “Drosophila: a teaching tool” section (33-37)
Larger point that first fly crosses the threshold into the lab and THEN it’s discovered to be very well suited to experimental work b/c large scale of breeding à “the Breeder reactor”. When experiments scaled up with larger numbers breeding, then mutations started showing up in sufficient numbers to be useful, and the large scale prompted Morgan to shift to a different mode of experimentation: GENETIC MAPPING, which the fly was very well suited for.

3: Constructing Drosophila
“The construction of Drosophila … was like the construction of any laboratory technology. It involved a choice of alternative product designs—organ formula or chromosome map—and the invention of standard tools and a complex system of mass production to make them work. Wild drosophilas had to be rebuilt to serve drosophilists’ purposes. The natural variability of wild flies had to be controlled, first by means of literary devices, which disclosed the practical limitations of mapping with half-wild stocks, then in more concrete and permanent ways. Standard experimental conditions and procedures were established, aimed at minimizing opportunities for half-wild drosophilas to dispay their inbred talent of adapting to a changeable environment. Finally, the variability was eliminated by constructing artificial varieties that behaved genetically only in ways that confirmed to standard principles of neo-mendelian genetics and chromosomal cartography.” (87-88)
standard flies were co-developed with the chromosomal map method as the map became a way to deal with the large amount of data coming in from the flies. The chromosomal mechanics was selected in the end as the research topic not just because it was a good topic, BUT BECAUSE it dovetailed better with the material conditions and restrictions of working with the standard fly—my words in this

4: The Fly People
From the directory: “I then turn to the construction around Morgan’s group’s mapping project of a distinctive human community, the fly group, and of an extended network of fly people who were connected by means of a system of exchanging standard stocks and craft knowledge (chapters 4 and 5)” (13)
Now, chapter about the social norms of fly work, focusing on moral economy, and described as an ecology in the chapter. “Social relations among the fly people were also adapted to the conditions of their work together. The fly group was a hybrid institution: a small research institute with a permanent core of full-time workers encysted in a large academic department.” (91)
Some of the conventions were informed by the understanding that everyone was working on the same organismà the person who did the experiment got credit, not the person who had the idea.
Politics of Morgan’s “boys” Authority and who get into core group. There’s some amount of generational tension. There’s also a division of labor and research type between elite and rank & file
àGroup psycho-social relationships as male mentor mentee kind of thing (96). Reproductive model of scientific training. However, collective training of graduate students, even as Morgan was only full professor at this stage. Did not give students research questions
Healthy culture of shoptalk about the material arrangement and smooth functioning of the lab. Ideas conceived of during shop talk were communal property of entire lab.
Also culture of ideas as communal

5: The Drosophila Exchange Network
Sharing and mutual aid. High reproductive rate of the flies undermined former competitiveness for working with specific species. Since drosophila were so productive, it made sense to ship out as many to other researchs as possible; no benefit in restricting access to fly. In fact, material realities incentivized sharing (137)!
Outsourcing to underused labor post degree inflation. There was some division between central specializations (elite) and peripheral specializations (140)

Part Two: Expanding the System

6: Improvisations
From the directory: “I turn again to the standard fly, to examine how the capabilities for genetic mapping that were built into it in the 1910s hampered efforts in the 1920s to use it to explore the genetics of development and evolution (chapter 6)” (14)
Chromosomal mapping and mechanics was the chief focus of research. It was SO productive and versatile in a way, it left little room for other types of work. For one thing all the equipment, including the fly, was set up and specialized for chromosomal work. For another, it yielded more immediate and clear results, which made it easier to publish more frequently and to with greater rewards and professional respect and acclaim.
Of course, people still tried to try new things, particularly as they recognized that there were major research gaps in areas NOT chromosomal mechanics—like evolutionary biology, other forms of genetics, embryology and so on. But in a way, as all the machinery were oriented towards chromosomal stuff, for the people in the fly group who wanted to try a different approach, they would improvise, building off the current methods and available materials—this is the improvisation phase. But of course, there’s something of a learning curve, and it was often too challenging to work out the bugs in time to be publishing at a desirable rate. The typical pattern Kohler identifies was improvisation and retreat.
There were mainstream, entrenched and convenient modes of production, so while there were improvisational attempts at innovation, they were hareder to have competing against easier and more rewarded topics and strategiesà the reasons why chromosomal mechanics was seen as the favored type of research over evolutionary or embryology was NOT ideological in Kohler’s reading. Rather they was material, cultural and social.

7: Reconstructing Drosophila: Developmental Genetics
From the directory: “ Finally, I relate how in the 1930s new experimental systems were invented to reunite classical genetixs with development and evolution by applying to Drosophila methods from other disciplines, such as embryology, biochemistry, and natural history (chapters 7 and 8)” (14)
If the last chapter showed the fly group trying in a haphazard, improvisational fashion to get lines of inquiry started in Evolutionary and developmental fields in 1920s, this chapter and the next show how the successes in the 1930s for starting solid inquiries in these fields happened! This chapter, it’s developmental embryology thing.
In a general sense, what worked was hybridizing the practices of the fly lab with practices from other fields—the opening of the field and the fly lab to researchers with different backgrounds who imported practices from their own work in developmental embryology or biochemisty. The structure of the fly group actually encouraged this with the continual traffic of grad students and postdocs etc.
The hybridization with new practices also caused a shift to a reconstructed model organism—one set up to optimize observations of the new practices—and one set up to better align with the thought processes and assumptions in the new modes of embryology and biochemistry. Example in biochemistry: Introduction of biochemistry into lab (227) “tricks to finding methods that are unknown to the uninitiated” (230). More basic poing that new approaches demanded changes to fly and experimental processes—hence “reconstruction.” Turning drosophila into reactant for injected biochemical as opposed to genetic material? Eventually Neurospora, a different model organism, is better for these methods because it’s a simpler organism.
BUT GOOD FACTOID HERE: “The extinction of a standard lab animal is a rare event”! 249)

8: From Laboratory to Field: Evolutionary Genetics
Not to simplify too much, but it’s another story of the hybridization of work practices between fly work and biological field work. Even goes so far as to frame Dobzhansky as a hybrid between labwork and fieldwork.
The fieldwork with flies starting working better as it scaled up! The scaling up of work on pseudoobscura enabled change to growth in evolutionary field for flies. But also charges lodged against him: “sloppy workmanship” connected with this large scale—he had so many samples from fieldwork that he couldn’t go through them all with the amount of attention other expected.
But there was also divergence in the workpractices of Dobzhansky (the fieldwork guy) and the others, there was less division of labor between him and the other fly people as they worked in different modes. Kohler identifies this as the reason for the rift between him and Sturtevant
Lovely description of routines and considerations for collecting wild flies (280).
