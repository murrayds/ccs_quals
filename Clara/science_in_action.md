#### Descriptive Summary


	1. What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?


“Instead of black boxing the technical aspects of science and then looking for social influences and biases, we realized in the Introduction that it would be much simpler it was to be there before the box closes and becomes black. With themselves, in their efforts to close one black box and to open another.” (21)
“Although is sounds counter-intuitive at first, the more technical and specialized a literature is, the more ‘social’ it becomes, since the number of associations necessary to drive readers out and force them into accepting a claim as a fact increase.” (62)
On the lab “Once the fact is constructed there is no instrument to take into account and this si why the painstaking work necessary to tune the instruments often disappears fr0m popular science.” (69)

What is the main argument of the text?


What motivates Science in Action and undergirds its entire argument is Latour’s foundational choice to examine the process of scientific knowledge-making (science in action) before that knowledge has solidified into fact. Once a scientific assertion or theory has been verified to the point that it becomes fact, it becomes a black box, an unquestioned foundational truth that in future inquiries, we do not need to spend time or energy delving into or re-establishing the black box; it can be used more simply as a basis on which to build the following activities of scientific knowledge-making. However, as Latour is interested in the period before knowledge is black-boxed, I’ll return there. In the push and pull of un-settled knowledge, Latour first identifies two directions, or modalities, that we can take a claim that is not yet fact: a) we can travel downstream; accepting the claim as credible, what other questions can we answer? or b) we can travel upstream; not being ready to accept the claim, we can call the origins of the claim and the methodology that produced it into question. Latour characterizes the processes of science in action as highly adversarial, as scientists attempt to reinforce their own claims and work against attacks of dissenters by marshalling a bevy of resources in support of their claims. In chapter 1, “Literature,” Latour discusses the citing practices and rhetorical strategies that scientists employ to attempt to build their own papers into (sometimes unreadable) fortresses. These strategies include employing a bevy of credible citations that demonstrate that the claims are well supported on foundations of pre-established, black-boxed facts, and re-framing the supporting literatures in the citations to best be relevant to the author’s own paper. In chapter 2, “Laboratories,” Latour discusses the practices of knowledge-making in the laboratory, writing that these practices have been carefully aligned and attuned to demonstrate target outputs in very specific ways. Inscriptions are the visible outputs of novel data contributing to the scientist’s claim that the laboratory’s instruments have been set up to produce. These methods in the literature and the lab both wind up being very strong because they are backed by the power of the institutions and credibility of the authors that presented them (in literature moreso) and because they are grounded on already established black boxes, which are extremely difficult (and often foolish) to question. With all the unsettled scientific claims buttressed like this, the only way to argue against them is to produce different knowledge with the same processes and techniques for building up credibility.
Science in the making vs. Ready-made science
	1. 
Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported./ 5. Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument


 Latour uses the rhetorical figure of the dissenter over both of the chapters in part 1 as he produces a narrative where the dissenter tries to pick holes in scientific claims and is repeatedly unable to do so. The narrative demonstrates the barriers that scientists set up to rebuff the objections of this dissenter. In the end, Latour’s dissenter has to form counter-laboratories and perform the same kind of citation fortifying in the literature. Latour uses a litany of various scientific statements that all grow out of each other to talk through the various processes that scientific debates take, to support his discussion of modalities and illustrate the kind of credibility production that has to be performed in the literature.  Part of the fun of Latour is that he uses a lot of figures. This is the book with the many figures of pairs of Janus faces presenting both sides of many arguments in the action of science.
	1. 
Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text. / 6. Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.


This is an incredibly interesting entry in the theories of science of science, and the general Latour canon. Science in Action unpacks and discusses the ideological methodologies of science and the implicit practices in scientific knowledgemaking. In a way, it frames and discusses science as a social activity with its own paradigms and culture.
