Thomas Kuhn’s “The Road to Normal Science” and “The nature of Normal Science” from The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
1.    What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?
“In the absence of a paradigm or some candidate for a paradigm, all of the facts that could possibly pertain to the development of a given science are likely to seem equally relevant. As a result, early fact gathering is a far more nearly random activity than the one that subsequent scientific development makes familiar.” (15)
“When the individual scientist can take a paradigm for granted, he need no longer, in his major works, attempt to build his field anew, starting from first principles and justifying the use of each concept introduced.” (20)
“These three classes of problems—determination of significant fact, matching of facts with theory, and articulation of theory—exhaust, I think, the literature of normal science, both empirical and theoretical. They do not, of course, exhaust the entire literature of science.”(34)
2.    What is the main argument of the text?
These chapters describe how scientific paradigms develop out of a paradigm-less inquiry and how those paradigms change scientific practice in chapter 2, and three major goals that scientific activity can be grouped under during periods of normal science. A scientific paradigm is a overarching theory in a field that offers a framework for categorizing and making sense of the observable phenomena within that field, and determining which questions are worth asking within that field. In the vision Kuhn offers, in inquiry before a paradigm has been developed, facts and observations are much more random—think cabinets of curiosities and bestiaries—and it’s much more difficult to make sense of the information. Paradigms come into being as the scientists within the field develop larger theories that the observations can be fit into, and the theory that explains more of the observations wins out over theories that can explain less. Normal science is the period in which everyone (or everyone worth listening to) is operating under the same paradigm, with the happy benefit that there can be a stable set of base facts that do not have to be re-litigated every time a paper is written. During normal science, there are three main activities possible under the paradigm—you can make observations based on what you’d expect from the paradigm, you can explain how extant observations can fit into the paradigm, and since paradigms may still have vague or foggy parts, you can make observations and run experiments to resolve those foggy areas to expand the paradigm and make it more comprehensive and specific.
3.    Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported./ 5. Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument
Kuhn describes many historical examples of scientific fields and their beliefs and practices during different historical periods. He takes examples from what he calls pre-science periods, such as the collections of observations about static electricity and attraction and from periods of normal science. However, he describes not only the practices of the current paradigms of normal science, but he also describes practices during paradigms that have since been overturned, such as his discussion of fluid theory of electricity (18). Chapter 2 was basically an extended discussion of the development within the electrical field (pun intended).
4.    Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text. / 6. Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.
This is one of the major texts in history of science and philosophy of science. I feel like Kuhn’s vision of normal science is itself a paradigm that structures STS. That’s how big it is. Also, it’s another work that takes on describing the additive process of science. While I don’t think citations are explicitly discussed here, I think that we can still see this book contributing to STS studies of citation patterms. while Latour sees citation as a method for bastioning one’s own argument, Kuhn’s vision of citation seems to be about establishing where work fits into the existing paradigm. However, I think it’s important to also acknowledge that Kuhn’s discussion is extremely Eurocentric which makes it important to balance out with decolonial discussions of scientific development.
7.    Explain how this book may be relevant to your research.
I’m another person working a little in Prof. Sugimoto’s lab, and as we’re studying bibliometrics and the work of scientists, I think that the activities that Kuhn describes are very visible there. How do scientists interlock their work with the work of others?
