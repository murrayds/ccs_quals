#### Descriptive Summary

As gender dispartities are stubbonly persistant in the sciences and in engineering, despite gains in other areas, Xie and Shauman conduct a series of small studies/investigations to explore how and why these dispartities may arise and may be reinforced during the different stages of science careers. After the intro and a set-up chapter where they establish that there isn't any innate difference in Women's capacity to understand science or math (of course), The structure of the book follows the typical career track: interest and attainment in high school, interest in selecting science college major, attainment of science undergrad degree, career paths post degree, career paths after masters...then more specific studies of the adult science workforce including demographics mobility, research productivity in academic science, and the other issues intersecting gender dynamics for immigrant scientists. 

They reject the pipeline conceptualization that the source of the dispartity for women is that women "leak' out of the pipeline faster and the big solution is to get better retention--they argue for more complexity. (but I'm not sure that what they add is all that more complex?). The source of complexity they think is lacking is that the pipeline assumes that the only way into science is from early entry into a singular pathway with no deviations from science or entry at other stages (the persistance path--when you're in the "pipeline" continuously from earliest opportunities to emphasize science in gradeschool). Instead they find that women are more likely than men to enter science research at a later stage from outside the traditional trajectory
Anyway, their main intervention is to argue that gender disparities are the result of issues in both "supply and demand." What they are talking about has little resemblance to the economic use of supply and demand, but okay. To them, <em>Supply</em> is about the degree of women's desire to be scientists or engineers, and <em>demand</em> is about the tangible demands, requirements, and sacrifices that entering science as a women ential. they argue that while yes, bias (a demand) plays a role in the dispartiy, there is still a lesser degree of interest in science among women than among men (supply) but their argument isn't sexist. The lesser interest is shown to be an effect of social pressure, and an understanding that since science work is often understood as incompatible with other goals (having a family without a "wife" for free childcare etc.)

With the chapter arrangement, each chapter has a nice atomic finding:
2: girls are just as good at math and science in grade and high school. 
3: but amongst new freshmen, still a larger proportion of boys are intersted in science, as they've been conditioned, whereas girls have been conditioned to be less interested (among other reasons).
4:  men more likely than women to follow science pathway (persistance pathway) from beginning of university to degree. Women more likely to enter into science partway through degree. the major declared early (persistance pathway) seems to explain most of the difference between men and womens' attaining degrees in science at university
5: post-degree entry into science workforce. sex segregation between fields of study
6: career path after masters: big gender differences in family status--female scientists more likely to be single or divorced. 
7: geographic mobility: some discussion of trailing spouses
