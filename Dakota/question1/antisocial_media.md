#### Key Concepts
----

1. **Filter Bubble:** Describes the way that sites like Google and Facebook rweard users with more of what they tell the companies they want, thus narrowing fields of vision and potentially creating echo chambers of reinforced belief. The company does not do this on purpose, i.e., they do not lokk for liberal or conservative viepwoints in media. Rather, if people habitually and routinely reward certain sites, friends, and web pages with "likes", then they will be presented with much of the same content. Over time, these users will be presented with only that content that matches their demographics, their politics, and their interests. 
2. **Skinner box:** Vaidhyanathan quotes Cory Doctorow who uses the analogy of the Skinner box to describe Facebook. The Skinner box was a theoretical object for operant conditioning of rodents: if there is a level in a rat's cage that releases a food pellet every time it is pulled, then the rat will only use the lever when it is hungry; however, if the lever only releases a pellet some of the time, then the rat will press it repeaedly, because it is not sure what the trick is. Facebook is similar—it proves constant, low-level feedback, that keeps the user engaged over longer periods of time. In this way, Facebook is like Casion's as described by Schüll in *"Addicted by Design"*
3. **Privacy:** Vaidhyanathan uses privacy not to mean merely those aspects of our lives that we withold from others, nor to mean the autonomy to exercise will over our own information. Rather, privacy is used to describe the ways that we can manage our various reputations within and among various contexts, such as school church, work, and the public sphere. These border change and evolve, but they exist. However, facebook flattens all of these contexts and relationships into the single umbrella of "Friend". 
4. **Cryptopicon:** Foucault imagined a panopticon, where some centralized state exerted power over a populace, that the people would eventually internalize. However, Facebook demonstrates the alternative: where we are instead surveilled not from a single point, but from everywhere, and by everyone. This surveillance occurs as a result of the corporate and state infomration ecosystems within which we exist. Vaidhyanathan argues that this better represents the state of the world than the Panopticon. 
5. **Search costs:** The individual-level costs exerted on users when they must search the market for ethical or cheaper alternatives. Vaidhyanathan argues that placing the burden to save the world on companies will eventually place that burden on the users, who may not be able to do so because of the search costs. Because of search-costs, market-based ethics requires that we are all-knowing and benevolent, but we are not, so nothing changes. 
6. **Political engineering:** Like social engineering, it is the process of harvesting data about citizens 9whether from proprietary behavior records, census, voter records, poll data, etc.) and generating algorithmic tools that focus resources on those most likly to be affected by tailored messages. Political engineering is the state of the current landscape, pursued both by Obama and by Trump; Cambridge Analyticia is one example of this sort of engineering, though their claims were certainly overblown. Political engineering is a problem because it undermines efforts seeking broad consensus that cut across demographics. Moreover, political engineering amplified and accelerates the dynamics of motivation and activism, bolstering efforts to push political positions and candidates. 
7. **Disinformation:** An alternative to terms like "fake news", which has been co-opted by thosing hoping to erode trust in traditional news media. Disinformation, defined by Caroline Jack, describes information that is deliberately false or miselading; moreover, disinformation is often irresistable to users who want to read, comment, and share, making it easy to spread across social media platforms. Disinformaiton tends to divide people, debilitating discussions, eroding trust, and fragmenting shared knowledge and identity. 



#### Questions
----

***What is the main argument of the text?***

In this book, Siva Vaidhyanathan overviews how Facebook has, intentionally or not, sought to become the operating system of our lives, and how the effects of Facebook have contributed to many social ills today. Step by step, Vaidhyanathan argues that Facebook the many forms that Facebook has taken: as a *pleasure machine*, Facebook has made us addicted, designing interfaces that engage us for long periods and to stay plugged in. As a *surveillance machine* Facebook has crafted a world where everyone is surveiled by everyone, whether that be the state, a company, or those in our lives, and in so doing we have lost agency over our multiple identities. As an *attention machine* Facebook has wrestled control of our limited attentions in order to place more and more targeted advertisements under our gaze. As a *benevolence machine*, Facebook (and Marc Zuckerberg) have normalized a sort of company corporate responsibility that is undemocratic, and ultimately places burdens on the users to manage the harms and externalities of social media. As a *protest machine*, Facebook has done relatively little to spur social movements, but has lowered the transaction costs of coordination, in turn giving protestors a false sense of success that dissipates quickly, leaving the powerfurl in power, who may then go on to use Facebook or other social media to punish dissidents. As a *politics machine*, Facebook fashioned a new sort of politics, one dominated by tribal membership, resentment, and political engineering. Finally, as a *disinformation machine*, Facebook has created the conditions necessary to spread disinformation and hatred, eroding civil discource. 

This is a pessemistic book, and Vaidhyanathan offers few suggestions to remedy the world that Facebook has helped to make. This is because there is no way to tame Facebook, no way to make it better: the problem is that Facebook is very good at what it does, and the problem with Facebook is Facebook—the very idea faciliates all the issues we are currentl experiencing. 

Vaidhyanathan adopts a sort of mutual-sharing stance on technology and society—he comes from a Media Studies background, which has traditionally been fairly tech deterministic, however here he claims that technology is culture, and culture is technology, and there there is little point in separating coders from the code they write. 


***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***
 
Vaidhyanathan supports his argument by drawing on examples of Facebook's effects in the real world. For example, the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit vote are both given as examples of the ways that Facebook has faciliated the spread of disinformation and fragemneted public and political discource. These examples are also used to describe political engineering, as in Cambridge Analytica and similar organizations. In other chapters about the attention economy, Vaidhyanathan draws on the stories of other companies, like the Huffingotn Post, BuzzFeed, and Breitbart, in order to discuss how trust has eroded and discource has. become fragmented. 

However, many of Vaidhyanathan arguments are not supported by direct evidence *per se*, but instead he offers some theoretical frameworks the thinking about and discussing Facebook's effects. For example, he builds on Focoult's Panopticon and instead imagine a Cryptopticon, a different sort of surveillance apperatus. He draws on similar ideas throughout.


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

Vaidhyanathan hails from Media Studies, however he draws on a wide range of literatuer across sociology (Focoult), design (Schüll), Psychology (skinner and Doctrow), and more in order to discuss the effects of Facebook.

It is hard to pin down the contributions of this book—it reads simulatieously as pop science but also as a discussion from a Media Studies or STS perspective. I would say that it fits broadly within the STS literature, but has implicatiuons for media studies, sociology, psychology, design, journalism, and more. This broad range speaks to the ubiquity of Facebook. 


***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

This book does not really have any particular methdology. It acts more as a narrative lietature review, pulling a mix of both theoretical ideas and real-world examples in order to construct an understnading of Facebook and its various effects on the world. 
 

***Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.***

For one, this studies Facebook, one of the most ubiquitous technologeis and social platforms that exists today—this in and of itself makes it of interest to STS.

This book also draws on and develops some ideas form other literature relevant to STS, such as Schüll and Foucault. He uses these ideas to discuss Facebook, and media more generlaly. I think that some of these frames, especially the notion of the Cryptopicon, could be useful in other STS dsicussions.

Finally, Vaidhyanathan takes a viewpoing of a flattening of technology and culture—they are one and the same. I think that this viewpoint is of interest to STS, becuase it seems somewhwat different than the "mutual shaping" stance typically adopted in the literature. 


***What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. "We are collectively worse off because of Facebook. If you wanted to build a machine that would distribute propaganda to millions of people, distract them from important issues, energize hatred and bigrotry, erode social trust, undermine journalism, foster doubts about science, and engage in massive surveillance all at once, you would make something a lot like Facebook." (pg 19)

2. "Surveillance fosters harrassment and humiliation, whether its from the state or from other people and groups. We can't perform as responsible, informed, engaged citizens of a republic if significant segments of the polis are harasses, silenced, and threatened every time they attempt to engage in matters of public debate" (pg 55)

3. "The burden Facebook places on us is to protect *ourselves*—not those less aware of how Facebook works or the consequences of privacy violations, not those more vulnerable, and certaintly not the entire ecosystem. Protecting privacy is an environmental problem that Facebook treats as a matter of individual responsibility." (pg 74)

4. "Basically, we tend toward homophily. Our media system can correct for that tendency or it can reinforce it. Our current media ecosystem, dominated by Facebook, amplifies both our weakness for confirmation and our desire to cluster among the like-minded. It's not just the technology. It's not just the cultural proclivities of human beings. Technology is culture an culture is technology. All are part of the same system" (pg 95)

5. "Relying on corporations to address major global and even local problems is both undemocratic and apolitical. In democratic politics, difference and consensus determine agendas and priorities. Legislatures measure and aggregate public opinion. If corporations or philanthropies set the agenda for fixing the world, they mostly react to the wills of elites or even the personal agendas of corporate leaders" (pg 123)

6. "The presence of facebook does not make protests possible, more likely, or larger. But Facebook does make it easy to alert many people who have delcared a shared interest in infomration and plans. It lowers the transacion costs for early organization" (pg 130)

7. "We much, however, carefully consider what specific features and structures of Facebook make it so useful in such a consistent way by authoritarians and the moovements that support them...Facebook does not favor hatred. But hatred favors Facebook" (pg 195)

8. "Facebook ahs amplified some of our best and worst collective habits. But one thing has surely suffered: our ability to think through problems together" (pg 211)

9. "Apolitical responses to complex problems can't possibly work. We need to build a political movement to raise awareness, rally support, define an agenda, and build allliances. This movement must be global, or at least multinational...onlty the threat and force of stern state regulation can push companies to straighten up. That's both how it is and how it should be." (pg 219)

#### Relevance to my research
----

This is certaintly an interesting and timely piece. However, I have trouble tying it to my research. If any of the book were relevant, it would definintely be the chapter on disinformation, which discusses the erosion of trust in institutions.
