#### Key Concepts
----

1. **Work process:** Used in place of the simpler term work in order to highlight the fact that no single part of housework is a simple, homogeneous activity. This idea of “work process” reminds us that housework is a series of tasks linked to one another: for example, cooking requires procuring an energy source, acquiring ingredients, washing or drying dishes, and many more small and interrelated tasks. This term is also useful in the book for highlighting that the process of cooking has shifted as a result of industrialization. 

2. **Technological system:** Just as housework is composed of a series of related and heterogeneous activities, so too are the implements with which they are performed. For example, an electric stove will only work with the appropriate power outlet and wattage, so it must be hooked up to the relevant infrastructure; similarly, a washing machine requires water and soap. Focus on the wider technological system, rather than the individual technologies, frames the development of household technology not as the result of millions of individual decisions, but as a combination of decisions by individual households and also large-social processes for which the householders can be said to have had no control over. In essence, the term “technological system” brings the wider infrastructures into view, and in so doing, also brings in politicians, landlords, industrialists, and utility managers. 

3. **Mutual dependence:** Cowan uses this idea to understand how the household activities of husbands and wives were related in pre-industrial times, and that survival often meant working in tandem. While men and women performed separate tasks, their work was reciprocal: both were necessary for the maintenance of the home. In this way, there was mutual dependence between the sexes, a dependence that passed to children through gender norms. There were similar divisions that differentiated tasks between the young and the old, the skilled and unskilled, and the employee and employer. Over time, this changed, such that housework became “women’s work”, specifically the wife’s work. 



#### Questions
----


***What is the main argument of the text?***

The central thesis of this book is that industrialization has shifted the burden of domestic labor from adult men and children onto their mothers and wives, and that this process was facilitated by both the adoption of technologies and changing cultural norms resulting from capitalism. Cowan shows that, in spite of idealization of the household as somehow pre-modern and non-commercial, it is in fact not separate from the larger economic and social system. There is more work for mother to do in a  modern home because there is no one to help her with it. 

This history was written in response to the fact that in contemporary (1980s) america, women spend roughly equal time on housework than the mothers of the previous generation, which is especially odd given the rise of so many supposedly labor-saving technologies. Ruth Schwartz Cowan traces gendered work in households between pre-industrial agrarian households up through postwar america, painting a gradient of evolving cultural norms leading to the present day (1980s). Cowan argues that the “housewife” is a somewhat recent invention. Before the “housewife”, husbands and wives shared equal responsibility(and reciprocal tasks) in maintaining their home and associated lands. The concept of the housewife was emerged as the typical labor of men and children was mechanized and the adult men were pushed into the industrial workforce, and the children were pushed into schools. At the same time, women’s household work, even that work which was once considered degrading by the most affluent, became marked as virtuous—the responsibility for a healthy household was rested on women. Household technology aided this transition by decreasing the work needed for a decent standard of living, but ultimately never reducing the sum of work that the housewife performed. 

Industrialization changed the work processes of the housewife, but incompletely, or differently as compared to the husband’s work. For example, store-bought grain saved men and male children from operating the mill, whereas the stove made it such that men no longer had to chop firewood. However, the tasks traditionally performed by women remained, and they had increasingly less and less help. 


***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***

Cowan uses a mix of evidence to support her argument. The earlier history of her book is supported primarily by the firsthand experiences of individuals living in or moving to the U.S. and experiencing gendered roles, histories of the era, and primary source documents such as letters, court transcripts, and newspaper text. Using these, Cowan paints a picture of both the poor and the affluent agrarian households, and the gendered division of labor within. 

Using the early household as a starting point, Cowan begins to trace the history of technology and cultural gender roles. As she move forward in time, the evidence she draws upon changes. She still employs biography to flesh out the descriptions and personal experience of individuals at the time, but she also begins to draw on statistical and scientific studies of the time, particularly from self-proclaimed “home economists”. Using the quantitative descriptions of the time, Cowan outlines the distribution of labor and wealth between both gender and social class, backing up the observations with histories of the time and firsthand biographies. 

Another example that Cowan focuses on is the shift from production to consumption. Pre-industrial households were required to produce food, clothing, medicine, and other day-to-day objects. Men and women worked in tandem on these things. However, industrialization brought many of these things out of the home—general and grocery stores contained ingredients,  department stores sold clothing, and hospitals offered healthcare. Households thus began to shift towards consumption. The time that women had spent canning and cooking was instead spent driving between destinations, and so the automobile became the object through which the housewife did her most significant work. Cowan shows similar shifts occurring in home cleaning.


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

Cowan draws on surprisingly little “academic literature” to make her point, instead referring primarily to primary sources to craft her argument. Occasionally she references early feminist works such as Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique or economic texts, such as James T. Patterson’s America’s Struggle against Poverty, 1900 - 1980. Scientific literature from the earlier half of the 20th century is cited, but typically used as a primary source rather than a an authority. 

A pioneering work of its time, More Work for Mother seems to contribute more to the literature than it takes. It might be fair to call it a feminist history of household technology, or at least a history of technology with a focus on gendered roles in housework. Thus this book appears to contribute equally to STS, History of Technology, Gender Studies, and the Sociology of Gender. 

***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

As briefly described in the response to a previous question, Cowan uses a mix of primary accounts, histories and case-studies of the relevant time period, and primary documents, such as advertisements, transcripts, documents, and magazine stories. Her argument depends on tracing cultural change, and so Cown synthesizes her argument using a mix of other histories as well as her own analysis of historical documents.


***Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.***

Well, one would be that this is a history of technology, tracing the history of housework in America. Another is that this history traces the interaction between household technology, domestic life, and gender roles—the nexus between technology and society. Additionally, Cowan’s book also analyzes how larger-scale forces, such as consumerism and capitalism, can shape both technology and cultural norms.This book is a quintessential STS-style history of technology, one that follows the trajectory of a host of mutually dependent across time. 

***What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. "To put the case more generally: the industrialization of the home was determined partly by the decisions of individual householders but also partly by social processes over which the householders can be said to have had no control.” (pg 14)

2. “Men and children could be spared, to the schools, to the factories, to the offices of the burgeoning industrial economy. Adult women and their grown daughters, on the other hand, could not be spared: meals still had to be cooked; sick children had to be tended; infants to be nursed; clothes to be made, mended, and laundered—and industrialization had done nothing at all to ease the burden of those particular chores” (pg 66)

3. “For women, the transition to the industrial order was different. Merchant flour, cast-iron stoves, municipal water, and manufactured boots did not free them from their labors. Insofar as these commodities allowed men and boys to leave their homes, and insofar as these commodities also created new jobs that only women could perform, women were tied even more strongly than they had been before to their cast-iron hearths. ANgel food cakes, strawberry preserves, clean clothes, ironed ruffles, and leavened bread may have made life easier and pleasanter for their families, but they also kept women working at home” (pg 67)

4. “Technological systems that might have truly eliminated the labor of housewives could have been built (as we shall see); but such systems would have eliminated the home as well—a result that most Americans were consistently and insistently unwilling to accept” (pg 101)

5. “If the movement of married women into the labor force proceeded with what some social critics regarded as unseemly speed, it did so because many members of the generation that had been raised in the affluent society (those who were children of the baby boom, not the Depression, and who came to maturity and began forming their households in the 1960s and the 1970s) saw little reason to worry about the various social ills that might result from cold cereal for breakfast, from an occasional meal in a restaurant, from slightly dirty bathroom sinks or unironed sheets. Modern household technology facilitated women’s workforce participation not by freeing women from household labor but by making it possible for women to maintain decent standards in their homes without assistants and without a full-time commitment to housework” (pg 209-210)

6. “Thus there is more work for a mother to do in a modern home because there is no one left to help her with it. Almost all of the work that once stereotypically fell to men has been mechanized. Families tend to live a considerable distance from the place the male head of the household is employed; hence, men leave home early in the morning and return, frequently exhausted, late at night.[...] The end result is that, although the work is more productive (more services are performed, and more goods are produced, for every hour of work) and less laborious than it used to be, for most housewives it is just as time consuming and just as demanding.” (pg 201)

7. “In some communities, at some times, the gap between the standard of living of the two classes (“comfortable” and “uncomfortable”, or “poor” and “affluent”) was as great as it had ever been [...] But in other communities, at other times, the ability to live at a minimum standard of health and decency was no longer the provelate only of those who were affluent[...] The average housewife of less than modest means was living, at least some of the time, living at a higher standard than her mother had been able to attain” (190 - 191)


#### Relevance to my research
----
There is an  excellent paper that was published a few years ago that discussed the gendered division of scientific labor. In short, men were more likely to be in charge of a lab, hold the necessary funding, and own the required equipment to perform a project; women were more likely to perform the experimental work and other “labor” of science.
