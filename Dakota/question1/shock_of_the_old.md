#### Key Concepts
----

1. Spin-offs: This term is used to describe second-order effects from a technology. For example, railroads were said to have a stimulating effect on oher industries, such as engineering, steel, iron, and telegraphy—these effects would be "spin-off" effects. As another example, Space Race technology was said to generate many spin-offs.
2. 'Creole' technologies: Technologies that have been mixed or modified to fit local circumstances. 'Creole' is a complex work that commonly means local derivitives of something originally from elsewhere. The term 'creole' means "derived, but different from, the originating case. It sometimes carries the sense of hybrid between the incomer and the existing, though this is not the common form" (pg 43). Transportation has been rife with creole technologies, including creolizations of the use of cars, rickshaws, and boats, in various contexts to fit local needs. 

#### Questions

***What is the main argument of the text?***

This book argues that the new is not always good, and should not always be the focus of our histories and our interest. Instead, the old can be equally important. Edgerton points out that invention is not the same as implementation, and that histories all too often focus on the moment of invention rather than the specific contexts in which the objects of invention are used, re-used, and modified through their lifetime. Edgerton uses this book to advocate for a new, usage-first style of historical analysis of technology, one in which technology is viewed in terms of its tangible effects on the lives of individuals rather than vague notions of what a technology actually is. In addition, he advocates to seeing technologies not as innevitable, but as one choice among many technologies. Every moment of technologicla change is characterized by a choice, between existing means, or between a range of differnet technologies, sometimes radically different in benefit, but often only marginally different.  However, when looking back these alternatives are often invisible, but they are always there. 


***Describe The structure of the book's argument***
The book spends relatively little time on theoretical study, and instead proceeds directly into history and case study. Each chapter of the book is associated with a topic, such as "time", "production", "war", or "invention". The theoretical arguments sit mostly within the chapter "Significance" (the first, after the introduction) and "Invention" (the last, before the conclusion). The middle chapters largely present case studies related to various topical areas of science and technology. For example, the chapter "killing" outlines various killing technologies such as pesticides, bombs, lethal injection, and more. 

The point of each historical example and case study is to demonstrate the situatedness of technology and how the use-based view of technology as objects redefines our understnading of the technology and its history. For example, Edgerton uses the Railroad as an example to debunk the idea that this new technology lead to increased productivity.

The general flow of the book begins with many consumer and individual-level technologies, but towards the end shifts its focus to nations and other large centralized entiteis, especially militaries. 



***What sorts of evidence or examples does the author cite to support their argument?***

Edgerton provides many case studies and examples, using his new framing to analzye the history of technologies in new ways. 
- Maintenance of cars in developed vs. devleoping countries
- The significance (or lack thereof?) of the Railroad and the Space Race
- The killing power of the machete, which even in modern times, has been responsible for an immense number of deaths
- The development of the atomic bomb as it relates to effectiveness as a weapon of war
- Various examples of techno-nationalism and how they, collectively, become contradictory
- The rise of military-academic-industrial research and how this partnership lead to a more authoritarian conception of technology

Most of this evidence seems to come from primary or secondary archival or historical sources, however there is no mention (that I can see) of a specific archival process. 


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

This book sits in the History of Technolgy. In fact, Edgerton himself is a historian of technology, focusing on 20th century Britain, at King's College London. Throughout he draws on some literature in science and technology studies, such as Bowker & Star, however I would have to place the text itself and its contributions almost entirely in the "history" category. 


***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

In the introduction, Edgerton claims that his book shuns the traditional "innovation-centric" view of history and history of technology. Instead, Edgerton uses a "use-based" history of technology, where he focuses on how technologies are used in various contexts rather than focusing on the invention or innovative aspects of the technology. Edgerton claims that this approach allows technologies to dissapear, re-appear, and evolve, and highlights the contingent nature of tech, whereas the invention-centric perspective insteads focuses on diffusion and the innevitable adoption of new technologies. 

Additionally, Edgerton claims to treat technologies not as *Technologies*, but rather as objects. Edgerton believes that many histories have treated technologies as something special, and as such have given them a different sort of attention and framing than other objects. However, to Edgerton technologies are just objects, and objects have varying impacts on our lives at different times. This also allows a closer analysis of the distirbution of techologies across geography, groupgs, and time, as as the last sentence of the intro states: "Things belong to particular people in ways that technologies do not". 



***Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.***

The first theme that is of interest to STS is the new historical analytical method proposed by Edgerton, namely the "use-based" conception of technology, and of technology as an object. I think this view of technology is good, and maps in many ways to how technology is viewed in contemporary STS literature. 

Another idea that is on interest to STS is that of creole technologies—I know that researchers in STS have studied how populations adapt "foreign" technologies, and so I think the idea of creole technologies and examples given would be of interest to their study. However, I always ask the question of "what isn't a creole technology"? When exactly can one say that someone is in the same exact context in which a technology was designed? Even something produced in a MIT lab is likely to be re-purposed and modified 2 miles away somewhere in Boston. 

A third idea of interest to STS scholars is Edgerton's discussions of the significance of technology. I don't really agree with it, and I believe that he focuses too much on economic and healthcare indicators, but I think that this is an interesting point. How to we determinie the significance of a technology (or an object, in Edgerton's framing), and how do we disentangle the cultural vs. social vs. economic vs. environmental technologies? Is the significance of some technologies overvalues? undervalued?


***What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. "Thinking about the use of things, rater than of technology, connects us directly with the world we know rather than the strange world in which 'technology' lives. We speak of 'our' technology, meaninig the technology an age or a whole society. By contrast, 'things' fit into no such totality, and do not evoke what is often taken as an independent historical force. We discuss teh world of things as grown-ups, but technology as children. For example[...] Within society, states, and/or small groups have had disproportionate control; some societies have much more stuff than. others. In many places of the world much is owned by foreigners. Things belong to particular people in ways which technology does not" (pg xviii)

2. "The assumption that new is clearly superior to what went before has an important corollary: failure to move from one to the other is to be explained by 'conservatism', not to mention stupidity or straight forward ignorance. 'Resistance to new technology' becomes a problem to be adressed by psychologists, sociologists, even historians. But the idea of 'resistance' makes sense only if there are no alternatives. It is absurd to talk of resistance to technology or innovation in a world where individuals or societies simply could not accept every innovation, or indeed product, on offer. Resistence is requires. In choosing one technology, society was necessarily resisting *many* 'old' and 'new' alternative technologies. In that sense, many, perhaps most, technologies fail. However, some new technologies were indeed often additions to existing, alternative technologies. The bomber did not do away with armies or navies; the digital computer did not spell the end of the analog comupter until the 1960s." (pg 9)

3. "Maintenance is almost as widely distributed as use. As a consequence, maintenence and repair are the most widespead forms of technical expertise. Maintenance and repair have been the realm of the small trader and skilled workers. They were different from, marginal to and yet independent with the great systems of technics" (pg 80)

4. "The great bulk of invention—let alone the development of inventions— takes place, and always has done—a long way from university research laboratories, and no serious analyst of invention ever believed otherwise. Most invention has taken place in the world of use (including many radical inventions) and furthermore has been under the direct control of users. It has been the realm of the individual inventor, the laboratories, workshops and design centres of industrial firms, and the labroatories, workshops, and design centres of governments, and especially their armed forces." (pg 187)

5. "Calling for innovation is, paradoxically, a common way of avoiding change when change is not wanted. The argument that future science and technology will deal with global warming is an instance. It is implicitly arguing that in today's world only what we have is possible. Yet we have the technological capacity to do things very differently: we are not technologically determined." (pg 210)



#### Relevance to my research
----
Not really sure on this one. This text is largely a history, and I won't really be drawing on hisorical methods. I think that of the chapters listed, the two most relevant are "significance" (because determining "significance" of research is part of my discipline) and "invention" (having to do with policy and the military-industrial complex). s


#### Other Notes
----
I have mixed feelings about this book. I feel that the author undervalues the impact on technology on people that can't readily be viewed using economic or healthcare indicators, which is sort of ironic seeing as the whole shtick of this book is a focus on use over invention. For example, he claims that the space race lead to relatively little economic value, and calls it a "distraction" and "propaganda", but completely skips over the cultural effects of (a) having a shared cultural goal, (b) obtaining something difficult, (c) inspiring a greater interest in STEM careers, and (d) seeing the "one earth" view from orbit. These seem like huge items that Edgerton completely skips over; similar things could be said about the cultural and social impact of cars, contracpetives, atomic bombs, etc. These technologies had an impact, at least for a time, and that shouldn't be ignored just because it only raised productivity by 2 percent compared to the altenrative. 

Moreovr, some of Edgerton's evidence seems cherry-picked. For example, in regards to the Space Race spin-off technologies, Edgerton uses the example of teflon, a technology which NASA doesn't really advertise as a spin-off, to illustrate the low economic impact of the technology. However, he doesn't even discuss the wealth of other spin-offs and such that surely would not have existed in their form without the space race. I get it, there are always alternative technologies, but in some cases things like the Space Race generate new alternatives, adding more paths and more choices than might have otherwise been the case—I think that the addition of alternatives is an important thing to discuss. 

Finally, I believe that Edgerton dismisses second-order effects too easily. He briefly discusses second-order effects when discussing spin-offs, but there are so many other "second-order" effects that are never addressed. For instance: univeristy research produces individuals with deep tacit knowledge of a subject, who then works in government labs and industry—thus the research of academia *does* contribute to the research in these places. Similarly, the train allowed for more free movement, potentially increasing GDP-per-capita as individuals were able to move more freely to find work, but not necessary the tota GDP.
