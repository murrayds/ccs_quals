#### Key Concepts
----

1. ***Networked Publics*** Networked publics are publics that are restructured by networked technologies. A Public an imprecise term which generally means some accessible space in which people can gather freely. Networked publics are “publics both in the spatial sense and in the sense of an imagined community. THey are built on and through social media and other emergent technologies” (pg 9) Boyd goes on to say that “as social constructs, social media creates networked publics that allow people to see themselves as a part of a broader community”. Boyd clarifies that, compared to regular old publics, networked publics have different characteristics than traditional physical public spaces, including persistence (interactions stay around), visibility (potential audience who can bear witness), spradibility (each with which content can be shared), and searchability (ability to filter and find content). Boyd argues that social media embody such networked publics, and the majority of the book is spent discussing the ways in which teenagers shape and are shaped by these publics. 
2. ***Context collapse:*** When various aspects of a person’s identity intersect. “A context collapse occurs when people are forced to grapple simultaneously with otherwise unrelated social contexts that are rooted in different norms and seemingly demand different social responses” (pg 31). People in general navigate between multiple identities between social contexts such as with family, friends, work, school, etc., and context collapse would happen when, say, work friends come to interact with your family. Boyd shows that teenagers perform a great deal of identity work only, managing multiple personas on different platforms, each constituting a different context and geared towards a distinct audience. However, the nature of networked publics means that these contexts have a tendency to collapse, such as when a parent comments on a friend’s post. 
2. ***Social Stenography*** “The hiding of messages in plain sight by leveraging shared knowledge and cues embedded in particular social contexts” (pg 65). This is but one way in which teenagers enact their privacy, by covering messages in layers of in-jokes, culturally-specific references, and memes in order to render the message meaningless to outsiders.
3. ***Privacy*** Boyd discusses a unique perspective of privacy, the kind often imagined by teenagers involved in networked publics. Much of the scholarly conversation around privacy treats it as a binary: either you have it or you lost it. However, what Boyd’s study of teenagers reveals is that privacy is a practice, it is “something that they actively and continuously trying to achieve in spite of structural or social barriers that make it difficult to do so” (pg 60) moreover, this process of achieving privacy is ongoing, because social situations are never static. This is especially an issue in networked publics, where the persistence and searchability of interactions complicate the practice of privacy. Another aspect of the kind of “privacy” imagined teenagers is that they were mostly worried about privacy from people who had power in their lives—their parents and teachers—rather than companies or the state. Later, Boyd expands on this definition by stating that “privacy is not a static construct. It is not an inherent property of any particular information or setting. It is a process by which people seek to have control over a social situation by managing impressions, information flows, and contexts” (pg 76)


#### Questions
----


***What is the main argument of the text?***

The main argumetn of this text are the first two words of the title: "Its complicated". The purpose of this text is to complicate the popular notions of teenagers and computers: "digital natives", "teenage addiction to technology", "cyberbullying", and "over-sharing" are all discussed, and more. For each topic, Boyd draws on ethnographic in order to show that the lives of teenagers engaging in so-called "networked commons" are more complicated, and more difficult than they immediately seem. The turn towards these networked commons is a result of these teenager's desire for agency, expression, and socialization, all of which are increasingly difficult in their world.

 A big focus of the book is adressing the many moral "panics" over teenagers, such as the fear of addiction, over-sharing, stranger-danger, and more. Boyd finds these fears to be largely unfounded, or to miss the mark completely from the troubles that teenagers actually face. 

Boyd argues that neither a techno-utopian or techno-pessimistic viewpoint is useful, and that no technological-deterministic viewpoint really captures what is happening with social media. Instead, boyd takes a "mutual shaping" approach, arguing that while social media has allowed various affordances and has certaintly impacted the lives of teenagers, it has not radically changed their desires and behaviors—these are driven by social factors. 

Boyd argues that adult's fear for their children and of social media, as well as the surveillance of their children on these platforms, had lead to an unhealthy relationship: actions taken by parents which they believe will make their teenagers safe will instead just damage trust. These violations of trust will cause teenagers to further seek out distance online. While the fears of most adults/parents are overblown, there are very real issues in teenager's lives, some of which manifest on social media. Boyd argues that with more trust and more mutual understanding, that more productive interventions can be crafted that actually help teenagers. 

***Describe the structure of the text?***

Following a theoretical introduction wherin boyd discusses *networked publics* and the ideas surrounding them, the chapters progress along topical lines. Each chapter takes on a key concept in how teenagers use social media, and in each case she draws evidence from the hundereds of interviews and her ethnographic work over a ten year period. 

The first chapter examines how teenagers manage their identity, or identities online. Drawing on the work of Goffman, this chapter follows the lives of children as they manage different social context on social media, wherin people form different contexts (work, family, friends, school, etc.) are likely to interact. Boyd shows that, while teens are fairly adpet at this sort of identity management, it is difficult. It is especially difficult because these kids must manage their various identities under constant threat of adult suerveillance, and consistent schedulings made by these adults.  

The next chapter turns to the way that teenagers imagine and enact privacy. Boyd shows that the, contrary to popular adult opinion, teenagers *do* in fact care about privacy. However the concern of privacy is not born out of fear of corporations and governments, but about the adults that hold more immediate power in their lives. Moreover, teenagers view privacy not as a binary (have it or don't), but as a process that they must constantly manage and sustain. Due to the unique nature of networked publics, teenagers have a wealth of methods of enacting privacy.

Chapter three focuses on the idea that teenagers are *addicted* to social media. Boyd shows that, if anything, teenagers are addicted to their friends rather than technology. In fact, boyd finds that teens would much rather meet in person, but the tight schedules and isolation imposed by their parents make that impossible. Boyd however focuses on how the adult rhetoric around *addiction* is actually toxic, and does not represent the ways in which these technologies are being used by teens.

The following chapter discusses *danger* in the context of social media, and the impact that adult's fear plays in teen's lives. Boyd contends that American society is heavily based on fear, and that parents feel that they must protect their chidlren from a dangerous world. This fear is projected onto digital technologies and social media. Boyd argues, however, that this fear is unfounded, both in the physical and digital worlds. In this chapter, boyd shows how children internalize or navigate these notions of danger in the online world. A particular focus of this chapter relates to the fear of sexual solicitation by strangers, a fear which boyd argues is mostly unfounded, and which obscures a myriad of other unhealthy online encounters and behaviors. 

Next, boyd turns to bullying. She finds that teenagers don't really use the term "bullying" to mean the same thing that adults mean, and that instead "bullying" has a much more narrow definintion. Isntead, teenagers use the notion of "drama", which can include everything from minor disputes to relationship agression. She shows that although new forms of drama have found a home on social media, social media has not radically changed the dynamics of bullying.

In the following chapter, Boyd focuses on the notions of inequality on social media. She argues that social media (and the internet in general) promised to decrease inequality by opening up everyone to new people and information. While boyd agrees that this is possible *in principal*, it is precluded by the ways that teenagers use technology. Teenagers enter the networked commons with their existing social networks, networks formed by long histories of prejudice, inequality, and culture. People rarely extend these networks online. As such, the inequaliteis of the present are reproduced online. 

In chapter 7, Boyd discusses the idea of the *digital native*—this idea that teenagers are born in the digital age, and supposedly have latent knoweldge of technology. Boyd, however, shows that teenagers are not as tech savvy as many adults would like to think; while they may have an intuitive understanding of what search results will lead to their desired answers, they have little understnaidng of how to critically examine information, the way that google rankings work, or the ways in which their information is tracked. Boyd then argues that the digital native rhetoric, as used politically, is dangerous. It is dangerous because it removes responsibility for schools to teach technical and digital literacy; why would they, if they believe that a new generation of techniclogically-sophisticated teenagers would soon be taking over?

Finally, Boyd closes with a summarization of her theoretical concepts and the ideas covered in the text. She speaks briefly of the political nature of social media and of how teenagers are perceived when taking political action. She closes with a call to action for adults to take teenagers, their lives, their issues, and their cocnerns seriously. In doing so, teenagers and adults can work together to craft solutions that give the teenagers both agency and safety.


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

This text largely draws on literature in sociology and anthropology. In relation to identity management, boyd reference Goffman. Concerning parent and societal surveillance, she turns to Foucault. There are a range of other citations, but I am not too farmiliar with them.

danah boyd has a PhD from the School of Information at UC Berkely with a focus on New Media. Thus, this text fits well within the realm of media studies (though I know little about this). However, the focus on teenagers using ethnographic methods would also seem to make this text contribute to anthropology and related disciplines. 


***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

This book is based on qualitative and ethnographic material collected between 2003 and 2010. The interviews were conducted with teenagers across the United States from a range of backgrounds. Pieces of these interviews are provided throughout the text in order to support boyd's arguments. Boyd acchknowledges that her work fits within the American context only, and she is careful to make this explicit throughout the text. She also notes that her work is somewhat out of date (there are many references to MySpace), which I think is *somewhat* of an issue in the realm of social media. However, I believe that all of her work stands, and will continue to stand in future years, much like Sherry Turkle's has done. 

***Describe themes or topics from the text that are of general interest in STS.***

The idea of networked commons could apply to a large number of online spaces that are of interest to STS, from Facebook and Instagram to other things like Overwatch and Fortnite. Danah boyd provides a wonderful foundation for exploring this idea further in other contexts.

Boyd's chapter on digital literacy was especially interseting to me, and provides a nice contrast to the ideas from Eubanks in *Automated Inequality*. Whereas Eubanks found that adult women were participanting in the "digital economy", boyd instead argues that maybe there is some difference between "digital native" and being digitally-literate. I think digital literatcy is an intersitng idea, and speaks to the tacit knowledge that individuals gain about technology. 

As far as I understand, a great deal of work in STS has centered on how people manage their identities online, whether that be on social media platforms or through their avatars on video games. Chapter 1, which deals with this idea, is of interesting to this segment of STS literature. 

***What quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

“As teens struggle to make sense of different social contexts and present themselves appropriately, one thing becomes clear: the internet has not evolved into an idyllic zone in which people are free from the limitations of the embodied world. Teens are struggling to make sense of who they are and how they fit into society in an environment in which contexts are networked and collapsed, audiences are invisible, and anything they say or do can easily be taken out of context. They are grappling with battles that adults face, but they are doing so while under constant surveillance and without firm grasp of who they are. In short, they’re navigating one heck of a cultural labyrinth” (pg 53)

“Regardless of how they explicitly choose to respond to it, teens are configured by the surveillance that they experience. It shapes their understanding of the social context and undermines their agency, challenging their ability to control the social situation meaningfully. As a result, what teens do to achieve privacy often looks quite different than what most adults would expect as appropriate tactics. Teens assume that they are being watched, and so they try to find privacy within settings rather than in opposition to public-ness.” (pg 74) 

“Social media does not radically rework teen’s social networks. As a result, technology does not radically reconfigure inequality. The transformative potential of the internet to restructure social networks in order to reduce structural inequality rests heavily on people’s ability to leverage it to make new connections. This is not how youth use social media” (pg 173)

“I believe that digital natives rhetoric is worse than inaccurate: it is dangerous. Because of how society has politicized this language, italows soe to eschew responsibility for helping youth and adults navigate a networked world. If we view skills and knowledge as inherently generational, then organized efforts to achieve needed forms of literacy are unnecessary. In other words, a focus on today’s youth as digital natives presumes that all we as a society need to do is to be patient and wait for a generation of these gitial wunderkinds to grow up. A laissez-faire attitude is unlikely to eradicate the inequalities that continue to emerge. Likewise, these attitudes will not empower average youth to be more sophisticated internet participants” (pg 197)

“Growing up in and being part of networked publics is complicated. The realities that youth face do not fit into near utopian or dystopian frames, nor will eliminating technology solve the problems they encounter. Networked publics are here to stay. Rather than resisting technology or fearing what might happen if youth embrace social media, adults should help youth develop the skills and perspective to productively navigate the complications brought above by living in networked publics. Collaboratively, adults and youth can help create a networked world that we all want to live in. “ (pg 213, last paragraph)

#### Other Notes
----
She uses the word "amplification" a fair amount in order to describe the role of technology amid teenager's behavior. This idea seems to fit well with Toyama's *Law of Amplification* in Geek Heresy.

There are many obvious paralells with Sherry Turke's work, though this work seems to generalize more about the social lives of teenagers, rather than focus on the elements of their specific interactions with technologies. 

The "Digital Literacy" chapter has a great deal of overlap with Eubank's *Automated Inequality*
