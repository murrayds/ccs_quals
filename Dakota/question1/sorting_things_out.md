#### Key Concepts
----

1. **Classification:** The authors use a broad and pragmatic definition: "anything consistently called a classification system and *treated* as such can be included in the term. The authors also think of classifications as objects of cooperation across social worlds, or as **boundary objects**. The authors also consider classification to be a large-scale infrastructure. All classification schemes (and standards) are mixtures of physical entities such as paper forms and computer code, and conventional arrangements such as speed, rythm, and dimensions. 
2. **Standards:** Not exactly a classification, but an importnat part of the way that we classify the world. A "standard" is any set of agreed-upon rules for the production of (textual or material) objects. Additionally, they tend to span multiple communities of practice and sites of activity, and persist over time. They are often deployed for the purposes of making things work together, and tend to be enforced by legal bodies. There is alo no law that the "best standard" will win—standards atre the products of polotics and negotiations, not of technical superiority. Classifications may or may not become standards. 
3. **Boundary Objects:** The authors define boundary objects as those objects that both inhabit several communities of practice *and* satisfy the information requirements of each of them. They are able to both travel across social borders and settings, yet maintain some sort of constant identify when they do so. This is achieved by being weakly structured, with stronger structure imposed by people within certain communities and settings. 
4. **Nomenclature:** A nomenclature is merely a list of naes that does not give any indication of cause. A classification, on the other hand, gives causes and aranges them in relation to one another. 
5. **Infrastructure:** Can be defined as technologies, physical or social, that hold a set of characteristics. hey are *embedded*, such that they have sunk into, or inside of, other structures, social arrangements, and technologies. They are *transparent*, in that they do not have to be reinvented or re-assembleed for each task. They have *reach* or *scope* beyond a single event or one-site task. People learn of infrastructures by *membership* in relevant social groups, and new participants will become farmiliar with infrastructures as they become members. Infrastructures also have *links with conventions of practice*, shaping and being chaped by the conventions of the community in which the infrastructure is used. Infrastructures *embody standards*, and different infrastructures will have different standards, which often require adapters and solutions to remedy when they converge. Infrastructure does not come out of nothing—it is *built on an installed base*, often the older infrastructures before it. A key characteristic of infrastructures is that they are often invisible, but they *become visible upon breakdown*. Finally, infrastructure is *fixed in modular incremembets, never all at once or globally*—the infrastructure is big, layered, and complex, and thus changes take time and negotiation between groups. 
6. **Infrastructure Inversion:** "A struggle against the tendency of infratructure to dissapear (except when breaking down). It means learning to look closely at technologies and arrangemenets that, by design, and by habit, tend to fade into the woodword (sometimes literally!)" (pg 34). This is the same sort of process as that carried out by Paul Edwards in "A Vast Machine"—it is the interrogation and analysis of infrastructures.
7. **Community of practice:** A community of practice (or social world) is a unit of analysis that cuts across formal organizations, institutions like family and church, and other forms of association such as social movements. It is, put simply, the set of relations among people doing things together. Activities in the community, with stuff and routines, constitue the community structure. The people in the community conduct activities together. Membership in these groups is a complex process. Becoming a member means becoming farmiliar with the activities, processes, and information of the community of practice. 

#### Questions

***What is the main argument of the text?***

The main argument of this text is that classifications and categories are historically situated artifacts, situaed within and between communities of practice. Moreover, the authors show that classification can have both positive and negative effects: it can simplify, but it can also marginalize and exclude. For example, uniform terminology greatly benefits medical communities, allowing many distinct communities of practice to operate together with little friction; however, classifications also used as a tool for oppression and exclusion in South Africa. 

Understanding classification is importnat because classification tasks impact virtually every task in day-to-day life and even in the creation of our identity. Studying classifications is also important for listering to marginal people and those existing between communities—understanding where these classification systems change or break down is important to understanding the experiences of these marginalized groups. Moreover, large-scale information infrasrucures are becoming more common, inciting attempts to standardize and categorize across communities. As such, more work is necessary to study these classification systems to understand how information structures cut across communities and contexts. 


***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***

Part of the “argument” of this book is outlining a method of analyzing artifacts classification by analyzing infrastructures, and the arguments support this argument through demonstration. They analyze the tensions that arise in systems of classifications at different times and places. 

The first half of their bok focuses on the ICD medical classifications, where the authors conduct a historical analysis on how diseases and ailments were classified by different groups, and how this developed into the model classification system. The authors use this analysis to understnad how different communities interpret and define the system, and also the politicol, material, and social aspects that dominate its use. 

They authors go on to perform a historical analysis of South Africa racial classification infrastructures under Apartheid, which is used mostly to analyze ambiguity and multiplicity, those that belong to multiple communities or lack a central community. This analysis is largely within chapter 6. 


The authors also analyze the design of a new infrastructure for classifying the work that nurses do This analysis uncovers the tensions that exist among the visibility and surveillance of work, between personal (or organizational) autonomy and central control, and during attempts at standardization even between similar communities of practice. This argument dominates chapter 7.

 
The final support given for their argument is the methodology itself, and a careful outline provided in chapter one and chapter nine, which details a set of terms, definitions, and metaphors that are used throughout the text to understand various infrastructures of classification and classification work. In chapter 9, the authors push to outline moral and ethical imperatives to their methodology, and the study of classification in general. 


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

The authors claim that their work sits at the "crossroads of the sociology of knowledge and technology, history, and information science" (p. 6). As such, the literature they focus on is firmly based in STS and sociology, including such figures as Bruno Latour (especially Science in Action) and Michel Foucault. They also use feminist theory, particularly that of Donna Haraway's Cyborg Manifesto.  When discussing classification work, particularly in the nursing chapter, they draw on work on professionalization and cooperation. Basically, they draw on a lot of different literatures, with a few key figures throughout, but with others whom they only reference on a topical basis.


***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

THis is largely a theoretical work suppored by historical analysis of specific case studies of classification systems at different places and times. They largely draw on archives, writings, and case studies of others to frame their argument. 


***Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.***

Methodologically, STS is often concerned with case studies and exploring the difference (or lack thereof) between things: what is the difference between science and technology? Between technology and politics? Between politics and science? Charting the ambiguities that arise from such categorizations are of common interest to STS. 

Also of interest to STS researchers is the running theme of scientifically-based classification schemes. This includes folk science used to justify racial hierarchies and categorization, or the push for scientifically-backed classifications of nursing work. To quote the authors, “to be human is to classify”, and in contemporary society, “science” is used to justify classifications, thus forming a solid link between the two. Thus, to study science and society, classification systems are a good place to look. 

As a third of may potential topics of interest that might be of interest to STS researchers is the mention of science as a good place to study classification systems. Researchers routinely consider and debate categories, constantly naturalizing and  de-naturalizing objects, and consistently moving between communities of practice. Classification and science are strongly linked, allowing STS to study both easily.


***What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

*“Throughout this books we have demonstrated that categories are tied to the things that people do; to the worlds to which they belong. In large-scale systems those worlds often come into conflict. The conflicts are resolved in a variety of ways. Sometimes boundary objects are created that allow for cooperation across borders. At other times, such as in the case of apartheid, voices are stifles and violence obtains”* (pg 283)


*“...categories are historically situated artifacts and, like all artifacts, are learned as part of membership in communities of practice...Classifications as technologies are powerful artifacts that may link thousands of communities and span highly complex boundaries”* (pg 287)


*“A classification system is an important tool in the struggle for professional recognition. When the tensions among visibility, comparability, and control are skillfully managed in the construction of the classification system itself, the same processes need to be balanced at the levels of users and policy makers...Professionalization through visibility alone may have latent consequences: constant surveillance in the name of the panopticon of cost containment (Foucault, 1979). In this era of information infrastructure shifts, the significance of this scenario is enormous”* (pg 253)



#### Relevance to my research
----

This book centers on classification which is a key task of modern data science. Most machine learning tasks are actually classification tasks. In many cases, the desired classifiation system is dreamt up by a programmer, yet treated as some sort of objective categorization. However, the classifications that machine learning programmers model are socially and historically situated. For example, a classifier that takes as input text and attempts to classify whether the author is male or female already makes several socially-related assumptions: (1) that men and women write differently, and (2) that gender is a binary between male and female, and (3) that this is a useful classification task. Machine learning tasks formalize classifications and use them to make real-world decisions. As such, they should be considered carefully.
