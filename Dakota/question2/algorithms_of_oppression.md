#### Key Concepts
----

1. **Technological Redlining:** The effect of algorithms that reinforce oppressive social relaionshpis and enact new models of racial profiling. This term draws on the old real estate pracice of *reflining*, which was the practice by which people of color were more likely o pay higher interest rates and premiums due to their race, especailly if they lived in low income areas, or other systemic denial of services to these residents. 
2. **Algorithmic Oppression:** Occurs in cases when algorihmic- and data-driven failures are specific to people of color and women and which help to perpetuate inequalities and oppressive social structures.

***What is the main argument of the text?***

Here, Noble challenges the idea that search engines are neutral and that the internet is a tool for equality. Instead, she shows that search enginge rankings can act as tools of continued oppression of people of color and women. Moreover, Noble shows that private companies, such as Google, have a profit motive to maintain these stereotypes. To quote another source, "Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.". Noble also addresses technology culture, pointing to how while men dominate the propduction of technology and algortihms, leading to (un)intentional ignoring and exclusion of non-white and non-male perspectives. Noble speculates (with great evidence) that the racism and sexism online is in part responsible for violence in real life. 

The goal of the book is to bring attention to the biases inherent to currnet search engines, and to call for a breaking up of the monopolistic technology comapnies that profit from the sexis and racist material online. Instead, she calls for a public search alternative, one that is obligated to the needs of marginalized communities. Noble also calls that technology companies should employ a more diverse workforce—having a more racially and gender diverse workforce may better anticipate issues of racial inequality and disparities. 


***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***

Noble accumulates a mountain of evidence to support her arguments, drawn mostly from textual and content analyses of search engine results. 

1. This study initiallty began when seaching for "black girls" on a search engine, and finding among the top results and impages a range of sexually explicit images. She continues to show how search results can return racist or sexist content, and show how searches for racial groups, such as "black women" or "asian women" are associated with sexually explicit images, and searches for "black men" return results associated with criminality. Various examples of search results, like this, marks the cnetral evidence of the book (apart from some citations to data and results from other studies).
2. Noble also draws from a range of other examples to support her claims, such as examples of other racist or sexist technologies (such as inapropriately racist SnapChat filters) and failures of image recognition systems, all of which serve to perpatuate stereotypes. 
3. In the conclusion, Noble also conducts an interview with a black hairdresser named Kandis who operates in a predominatly white college town. This interview is used to provide a much more personal investigation of how marginalized people are disavantaged while navigating internet and search services. 



***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

This text sits within two main fields: Sociology, and Library and Infomration Science. Much of the literature cited comes from these two fields, and she pulls from a fair amount of scholars who are women and people of color. I do not know enough about this literature to really comment on it.

***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

The primary methodology is a text and content analysis of search engine results. I think that these searches serve as great examples of how racism and sexism can misrepresent people online, and how internet technologies can perpetuate harmful stereotypes. I will note however that much evidence is fairly outdated—search results from 2010 are hardly comparable to results in 2019. As such, its a bit hard to reconcile this evidence with Noble's main arguments: if Google has changed their search results, did they really ever have a profit motive to maintain the old racist or sexist rankings? Are these companies doing better work now? 


***What quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***


1. "Men, intending to or not, have used their control and monopoly over the domain of technology to further consolidate their social, political, and economic power in society and rarely give up these privelates to create structural shifts in these inheritances. Where men shape technology, they shape it to the exclusion of women, especially black women"

2. "What we find in search engines about people and culture is important. They oversimplify complex phenomena. They obscure any struggle over understanding, and they can mask history. Search results can reframe our thinking and deny is the ability to engage deeply with essential information and knowledge we need, knoweldge that has traditionally been learned through teachers, books, history, and experience. Search results, in the context of commercial advertising companies, lay the groundwork, as I have discussed throughout this book, for implicit bias: bias that is buttressed by advertising profits. Search engine results also function as a type of personal record and as records of commmunities, albeit unstable ones. In the context of commercial search, they signal what advertisers think we want, influenced by the kinds of information algortihms programmed to lead to popular and profitable web spaces. They galvanize attention, no matter the potential real-life cost, and they feign impartiality and objectivity in the process of displaying results."

3. "Algorithms tha rakn and prioritize for profits compromise our ability to engage with complicated ideas. There is no counterposition, nor is there a disclimer or framework for contextualizing what we get...But search results are not tied to a multiplicity of perspectives, and the epistemology of "ranking" f=from one to a million or more sites suggests that what is listed first is likely to be the most credible and trustworthy infomration available"

4. "Search does not merely present pages but structures of knwledge, and the results retrieved in a commercial search engine create their own aprticular material reality. Ranking is itself infomration that also reflects the political, social, and cultural values of the society that search egnine companies operate within, a notion that is often obscured in traditional information science studies"


#### Relevance to my research
----
For one, this text centers on search engines and the dangers of ranking. My research centers on the social dimensions of technology and knoweldge, which is the basis of this entire book. Noble shows how a data-driven technology may manifest as something which is certaintly not neutral, and instead impacted by polital forces. 

I think that this is especially useful for investigations of knoweldge formation and credibility on the internet, and for understanidng how rankings can impart significance.
