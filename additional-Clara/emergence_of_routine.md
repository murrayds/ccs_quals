Calls for a "Richer view of standardization as generative and flexible with potential to spur and preculde change" (114)

still concerns about centralization (116)
Conceptualizes routines as consciously planned (119)
Balances need for standards with the awareness that it would be impossible and undesirable to actually impose absolute uniformity--especially if this uniformity were to come from the top-down (122). 
"Dialectical approach" to the development of routines and standards. large-scale discussion and negotiation of many active engineers and actors with different needs (123)
"Bricolage" of routine! (124)
