#### Descriptive Summary


Tells the history of the founding of Jackson lab, but more generally the genesis of Mice as a standardized research animal.

0. Introduction: Why mice?
Radar's investigation oft eh development of genetically standard mice
turn to genetically standard(18) indicative of a turn toward or a solidifcation of the genetic approach to biomedicine
standardized mice adopted through consensus--consensus that biology experiments will be centrally coordinated--> and a consensus about the experimental framework.

describes early days of CC little's research in his graduate school days
picked up mice from fanciers and their initial breeding methods--THERE WAS ALREADY a framework in place for manipulating the genetics of mice
Then, there's little's early inbreeding work--the controversy over the necessity of specific genetic regulation for research
Early cold Spring colony
More explicit linkages between inbred mice work and genetic approach to animal research (50)
There was the Mouse CLub of America (54) had description of mouse club newsletter that did basically the axolotl newsletter does.

development of Jackson lab as an institution building
little's work during this period seems focused on working connections and securing funding for his scientific vision the necessity fo inbred mice
links to social policy and gross eugenics
Need for continutiy of mouse caretakers and scientific supervision (71)

Infrasturctural organization (99)
external mouse breeders needing to maintain own stocks often an obstacle for mouse genetics
shift to fully industrialized production of experimental mice often counter to research objectives and stance
Little initially objects to commercial breeding advocating instead cooperation of academic in-house programs (103)
BUT this is really hard to do with material constraints decentralized among labs (103-105)
Ooh, mouse geneticists kept close contact with mouse fanciers for collaboration (105)
The first time Little sold mice was in 1932 tin Bar Harbor (115)
"Uneasy transition" to selling mice "research --> production" (117-123
