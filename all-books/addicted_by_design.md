#### Key Concepts
----

1. **The Zone:** "Their aim is not to win, but simply to continue" (pg 12)—this is the state that gamblers seek to enter, and casinoes encourage. a "Space in which time, space, and social identity are suspended in the mechanical rythem of a repeating process" (pg 13). This state is one of fluid interaction between the human and the machine. This interaction doesn't last as long if mediated by humans, as during poker or table games. However, thanks to the seamless and effortless nature of digital gambling machines, people can maintain "the zone" as long as their wallet permits. Also look up the idea of "flow". 
4. **Coercie Relation:** Foucault describes a link between humans and their surrounding "disciplinary machinery" (the norms, surveilalnce, etc. of say, a school, or hospital, or any other place that exerts disciplinary pressures) as a coercice link with the apparetus of production. 
5. **Collusive Technology:** Contrary to the coercive relationship, Schüll argues instead of a *collusive* relationship—humans are not coerced or forced to discipline themselves—they are not self-vigilent, self-correcting *docile bodies*, but instead, they chosose to enter a flow state. In this collaborative relationship, the human is not playing to win, but instead is playing to keep playing to be suspended in *the zone*—the machine offers an environment to support the gambler. However, ths relationship is *asymetrical*. The efficiency, control, and power of the casino far outweights what the gambler brings to the relationship. 
8. ***extinction:*** The point at which player's funds run out, and they can no longer continue playing
9. ***Actionable Intelligence:*** Data collected from the casino, processed and arranged in an easy-to-understand visualization, "organized to facilitate insight into the financial implications of slot floor reconfigurations or new-marketing promotions". The human-interpretable form of raw data. 


#### Questions

***What is the main argument of the text?***

In her book, Schüll charts the design practices that (mostly U.S.) casinos use in order to maximize revenue. The majority of her analysis focuses on digital machines—slot and video poker machines—which have offered a newfound ability to casinos to experiment with new designs, tweak software, and tailor an experience to a particular user. Casinos, as Schüll argues, are interested in forming a very special type of relationship between players and machines. The relationship is asymmetrical, whereby the player hopes to enter ***“the zone”***—a state of deep focus concentration—and the machine (and casino) hopes to extend “the zone” for as long as possible, with the ideal goal being “extinction”. In a way, the player is a “docile body” as thought of by Foucault, conditioned and coerced by surrounding norms and surveillance in order to behave in a certain way (to keep playing). However, while Foucault describes a coercive relation, Schüll argues that casinos instead push a relationship of collusion, whereby the player willingly takes part but is guided by the techniques of the casino and machine. Casinos enact and improve this relationship through the careful design of architecture, software design, payment methods, and data tracking. These techniques are concerning, not only because surveillance and “collusive” technology often originates in casinos, but because we also see these same techniques in everyday life, such as in popular video games, social media, and more.



***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***

Each chapter of the book focuses on a different aspect of Casinos that Schüll explores. Of the chapters we read, the three key points were *design of environment, design of software/chance, and design of surveillance*.

1. Schüll describes the great deal of effort that goes into creating a Casino environment that entices and holds players, ranging from the lighting, the sonic characteristics, the layout of the casino (like a maze), the layout of the machines (clustered, relatively secluded), and even the aromas and atmospherics of the room. Everything about the casino has the goal of mesmerizing the patrons such that they tune out their surroundings, and inter into ***the zone***.

2. The rise of digital machines was a great boon to casinos, who now were not constrained by physical components. The mathematics of chance could be changed so as to award bigger, but less frequent payouts. Graphics could also be changed in order to entice and hold players. Slot machines could be programmed to more frequently display “near misses”, which enticed players to keep going. Also, new and more seamless payment methods could be devised that make the process of gambling and easy as possible, and to limit the amount of time that the player is not in their chair. I link this to ***deep design***, and the way that casinos treat patrons as ***docile bodies*** to be manipulated and experimented with. 

3. More recently, casinos have begun to feature a ***deep surveillance apparatus***. Through careful surveillance by group, the Casino is able to analyze which groups are most likely to be present at different times of day, and so can change the games and factors of the casino accordingly. But at the individual level, machines can also adapt themselves to the player, not only changing the speed of play, but in some cases offering them bonuses or some other incentive to keep them playing. This style of ***personalization*** is interesting, because the human may not be aware of it, and likely doesn't opt into it. This is what helps lead to a stronger ***collusive*** relationship between the human and the machine. 

***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

Schüll draws from a mix of STS and sociology literature in order to make per arguments. From sociology, she draws primarily from Foucault and especially his notions of docile bodies, controlled societies, and surveillance. From STS Schüll pulls from Latour, Haraway, Turkle, Suchman, and others. All in all, this text pulls from a variety of sources, but largely straddles the line between STS and Sociology. What is interesting is that Schüll rarely cites design scholars (or perhaps I just didn’t notice them, because I don’t recognize any of the names). Perhaps this means that Schüll is hoping to contribute to sociology and STS more than design. It's hard for me to say, because I don’t know anything about the design literature. 


***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

Most of Schüll’s analysis relies on interviews, specifically interviews with gamblers themselves, and professionals within the field. She also draws some from public documents, such a advertisements and transcripts from gaming conferences. 


***Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.***

1. This analysis largely concerns the relationship between humans and machines, in this case a very particular type of “collusive” and asymmetrical relationship that is moderated by the casino

2. Design is a key field to STS, and so anything on the topic of design (even if its design with arguably nefarious motivations) would seem to be of interest to STS

3. Related to the first point, surveillance technology has grown increasingly common, particularly in social media and other websites, but also in government organizations, business, and more who are able to track us through a variety of means. Mass surveillance has become easier, and this information can be used to tailor the relationship between human and machine, usually for capital or political gain. With recent revelations about Cambridge Analytics and the ongoing controversies of social media, this book seems particularly relevant to STS. 


***What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. “While designers’ orientation is calculative, rational, and focused on a distant statistical horizon in which profit is guaranteed, gamblers’ orientation is experimental, affective, and focused on the unpredictable outcomes of the very next spin; as their involvement in play deepens, they are likely to become less interested in winning than in continuing to play. It is not that repeat gamblers act “illogically” while playing machines, two gambling researchers clarity, for “their strategies are complex, intuitive, and adaptive”; yet these strategies, as we will see in the coming chapters, are not avaricious and do not rely on ‘rational’ calculation of odds”. Although ‘one might know that the odds are poor and that one inevitably loses over time,” writes another researcher, a different “type of knowing...:” may take over the process of gambling, especially if manines are designed with this effect”. In the gap between calculation and intuition, the gambling industry seeks revenue while players seek ***the zone.***” (pg 96-99)

2. “The network structures of contemporary casinos typifies the kind of power that animates “control societies” as Deleuze described them in 1990., writing just as digital information and communication technologies—on which the consumer tracking and marketing techniques described in this chapter are based—were coming onto the scene of everyday life [...] The system has become adaptably flexible, managing at one to place players at the wheel and to steer their movement; to put control “completely” in their hands—at their fingertips, as it were—and at the same time to guide the movement of those hands by turning a digital dial in the back room of the casino. As in control societies, an invisible web of communicating information technologies works not to ‘discipline and punish’ but to incite and reward. ‘The man of control is undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network,’ Deleuze wrote; in the zone, might be another way to phrase it” (pg 164)

3. “The most extreme of machine gamblers speak in terms of bodily “exit”, suggesting that “disembodied” is a more apt description for their relationship with technology than “embodied”[...] It is not just the body of the player but also the body of the machine that withdraws into the background, even as its console, screen, and game processes continue to enable to zone state.” (pg 174-175)

4. “The operational logic of the machine if programmed in such a way as to keep the gambler seated until the end—the point of ***“extinction”***, as some gaming executives call it—is reached.” (pg 180)


#### Relevance to my research
----
Flow state in programming—making of decisions without thought, consideration, or deliberation?

There is also the chapter about gaming probability, trying to stay wihtin the law while still gaining the most money possible. Casino's also change the perception of chance, making "near misses" appear more often in digital environments to as to make users keep playing. 

As is outlined in the "Live Data" chapter, the casinos collect a constract stream of large quantities of consumer data about who is using their machines. These data need, in turn, a technology and analytical tools in order to be stored, processed, and understood. These data-collection technologies can, at times, amount to customer surveillance. This is importnat, because, "Many surveillance innovations first used in casinos were only later adapted to other domains—including airports, fincnacial trading floors, consumer shopping malls, insurance agencies, banks, and government programs like Homeland Security".
