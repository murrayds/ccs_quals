#### Descriptive Summary

	* part 1 - design:

		* 1: interior design for interior states: architecture, ambience, affect
		* 2: engineering experience: the productive economy of player-centric design
		* 3: programming chance: the caluculation of enchantment

about casino design (ch1), machine +user interface design (ch2), engineering of chance (ch3) that work together in creating and continuing the flow state for gamblers. 
	* part 2 - feedback

		* 4: matching the market: innovation, intensification, habituation
		* 5: live data: tracking players, guiding play
		* 6: perfect contingency: from control to compulsion

games reorientied to how and where players, particularly heavy uses, play: play speeds up. transition from optimizing amount of money players spend toward lengthening time on device (ch4). also about the increased tracking and analysis of gamblers for further optimizing machines (ch5)Development of tolerance and pursuit of flow.
	* part 3 - addiction

		* 7: Gambled away: liquidating life
		* 8: Overdrive: chasing loss, playing to extinction

"suspending" of relationships, money, timeParadox of control in machine gambling--gamblers play in pursuit of feeling of control in the flow state, yet feel unable to control their gambling.
	* part 4 - adjustment

		* 9: balancing acts: the double bind of theraputics
		* 10: fix upon fix: recipies for regulating risk

weird confluence of gambling, medication, and therapy for gambling--history of attempts to regulate gambling and prevent abuse through to the present day. Many approaches locate responsibility in the gambler conclusion chapter discusses continuing expansion of gambling and the mixed feelings of designers

#### Relevant (analytical/critical) notes


What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?


"The less aware gamblers are of architectural and atmospheric space, the more likely they are to become absorbed in play. By the same token as their absorption increases over a session of play, the more impervious it becomes to potential distraction from disequilibrated or otherwise disruptive ambient elements" (49)
“In accordance with the affect-based orientation of contemporary capitalism whose spatial applications we considered in the previous chapter, desiners of gambling machines have increasingly close attention to gamblers' physical, sensory, and cognitive propensities."(53)
"The contradiction present in designers' accounts of video poker correspond to two opposing views of the local, repeat player: she is at once a savvy expert who chooses video poker becaseu she demands the highest degree of challenging an autonomy in play, and a player who gambles in a manner that is driven and impassive, without aim except for its own continuance" (177)

What is the main argument of the text?


In this book, Schull works to tease apart the many apparent contradictions of machine gambling, and reassemble them into a coherent portrait that explains its capacity to keep people playing to the point of compulsion. Central to the argument is the identification and articulation of the way that during compulsive gambling, the self of the gambler dissolves and is absorbed into the machine. Schull describes how gamblers become so focused on the machine that they ignore both eternal stimuli and the presence of their own bodies during gameplay. Furthermore, she describes in great detail how the design of the casinos, the games and the gamplay all work to facilitate the entry of the players into the Zone and to maximize the time on device. Gamblers are both after control, and trying to avoid the paralyzing tyranny of choice—this is achieved in games because they are composed of a series of predictable and manageable decisions, offering the sensation of choice without actually giving it. Furthermore, machine gambling also intersects with the logics of capitalism because they cause the gamblers to keep very careful account of money in certain ways (but still losing it). Money becomes the means of keeping the machine open and available.

Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported./ 5. Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument

Schull’s work is oriented around interviews with people who have had gambling addiction. Their stories provide strong illustrations of each of her points, and her points are informed and supported by well-developed narratives of her interviewee’s lives that she reconstructs from the content of the interviews. There are interviews with the game designers as well and she assembles and discusses documents showing the design and structure of the games. She also performs excellent close-readings of the structure of the casino floors.

Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text. / 6. Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.


Schull brings in a great deal of theoretical frameworks and works through extensive and illuminating discussions of theory. She draws especially frequently on sociological theorists such as Goffman and his compatriots. I’d like to learn more about to what extent these kinds of sociological works intersect with the ethnographic work that we’ve discussed previously in class, because there does seem to me to be a through-line, and maybe an ethnographic flavor to her deep descriptions of the structure of compulsive gamblers’ lives. I suppose that is a disciplinary question. Then, there’s also the discussion of some psychoanalytic concepts, like perfect contingency, that arise especially in the chapter about addiction. However, the most salient alignment of this book is its discussion of design and therefore its positioning as a book that can contribute to discussions of Human-computer interaction, albeit exploitative kinds of HCI.

Explain how this book may be relevant to your research.

(It's fascinating, but I'm not sure it directly is) Schull’s work may be useful for the way that she analyses design to discuss the underlying motivations and objectives that it promotes. As I’m TA-ing an Ethics in Computer Technology course this semester, I was thinking a lot about the way many of the students are in the process of trying to understand how design can be tied up with ethics.

the book could be applicable to thinking about the design of social media applications--they have also shifted toward prioritizing time on device

#### Quotes

“The turn to machine gambling mirrors the spread of consumer technologies like video games, personal computers, and the Internet— technologies, that have given rise to new and intensified forms of human-machine exchange, along with new sets of anxieties for selves, and new forms of self-escape. Here, I parse the escape that Patsy calls “machine life” into its different forms: escape from bodily existence; escape from social exchange; escape from monetary value; escape from chronological time.” (156)
“the gambling machine is not a conduit of chance that allows selfhood to emerge in a context of social and economic uncertainty, but rather, a dependable mechanism for securing a zone of certainty in an uncertain human world. While the human world is associated with dependence, temporality, unpredictability, mess, and dangerous remainders, the machine is linked to dissociation, atemporality, predictability, closure, and depletion— a deadly, circular sort of perfection.” (168)
“In the zone of machine play that compulsive gamblers describe, the conventional means of self-enterprise— money, time, sociality, and bodily existence— are disengaged from the agenda of the maximizing self, and put in the service of self-liquidation.” (169)
