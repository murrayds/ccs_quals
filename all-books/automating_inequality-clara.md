	1. What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?


“When we talk about the technologies that mediate our interactions with public agencies today, we tend to focus on their innovative qualities, the ways they break with convention…This myopic focus on what's new leads us to miss the important ways that digital tools are embedded in old systems of power and privilege.” (177)
“Think of the digital poorhouse as an invisible spider web woven of fiber optic strands. Each strand functions as a microphone, a camera, a fingerprint scanner, a GPS tracker, an alarm trip wire, and a crystal ball. Some of the strands are sticky. They are interconnected, creating a network that moves petabytes of data.” (188)
“Currently, the digital poorhouse concentrates administrative power in the hands of a small elite. Its integrated data systems and digital surveillance infrastructure offer a degree of control unrivaled in history. Automated tools for classifying the poor, left on their own, will produce towering inequalities unless we make an explicit commitment to forge another path. And yet we act as if justice will take care of itself.” (200)

What is the main argument of the text?


In Chapter 5—The Digital Poorhouse, Eubanks performs some useful summing up and tying together of the patterns that she discussed in Indiana, Los Angeles, Allegheny PA before she draws up a few recommendations for dismantling these systems in the conclusion. This chapter spins an extended metaphor of a digital poorhouse that entrenches the pre-existing systems that circumscribe the lives of poor people and deny them public resources in the same way that the brick and mortar poorhouses of the past have done. However, having traced the common threads between the literal and digital poorhouse systems, Eubanks describe 5 new characteristics of the digital poorhouse: 1—its systems are less transparent because they are controlled by algorithms that very few people write and understand; 2—it is massively scalable as automation allows it to be applied to many more people; 3—Once the system is in place, it is much easier to keep it going; 4—the data that the automated systems collect and the decisions they make can be stored indefinitely (much longer than paper records at least); 5—Our entire society is also undergirded by the assumptions that create the digital poorhouse (this isn’t new though?). Eubanks also argues that everyone should notice and care about this because the digital poorhouse affects everyone and it undermines our national ideals.

Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.


Eubanks uses a short historical overview of the rise of scientific charity in the 19th century in order to build a foundation for the digital poorhouse metaphor. With the description of the practices of the brick and mortar poorhouses, she is able to trace parallels with the present day systems, and better describe how the entrenched systems of power she uncovers in the digital poorhouse are not surprising new disruptions in systems of poverty.
Her discussion is also undergirded by Cohen’s concept of cultural denial (175), as laid out in the introduction of the chapter, in which the American social system makes a concerted effort to deny the presence and effects of poverty.
As I’ve mentioned before, Chapter 5 builds on the work that she has performed in the earlier chapters of her book, especially on the cases of Indiana, Los Angeles, and the Allegheny region.

Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.


I’m realizing that I’m not sure how this book will be characterized yet. Everything I’ve read for coursework in all my degree programs has been theory, history, literary history, or literary criticism. It feels awkward that I don’t know this yet, but what’s a book that attempts to describe present conditions, using some discussion of very recent history that may have led to current policies? This section will be updated soon. Anyway, Automating Inequality seems to be part of the trend for sociological texts that incorporate nonfiction narrative, such as Desmond’s 2017 bestseller Evicted. I really like this, and I’m really interested in the way it’s influencing the genre.

Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.


Since Chapter 5 is a concluding chapter, I’m going to reach into other chapters for this section. Eubanks writes these really masterful case studies, about a variety of people attempting to navigate the public benefits and medicare systems in Indiana during the 2006-2008 (and beyond) pilot welfare reform programs. In all honestly, I haven’t read very many formal case studies, but it seems like Eubanks’s studies have a more narrative style than the usual, which is both appropriate for the genre as a popular nonfiction book, and which provides a compelling and intricate portrait of the on-the-ground perils of trying to navigate automated welfare systems. Eubanks also uses interviews with sources, and she provides a careful description of her methods for contacting her collaborators (I think she uses this term?!) in the methods section. Her use of direct quotations and sourcing from interviews incorporates first-hand description of these systems.

Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.


STS is very concerned with the practices and effects of automation, and how systems of computing are deployed over social systems. As this book is also discussing practices that play some role in structuring and entrenching socioeconomic, class and racial divisions, it intersects with many other discussions in STS about technology’s role as a social and political agent.

Explain how this book may be relevant to your research.


I used to work with Charles Dickens’s novels, where the poorhouse and the workhouse hovered like a dark shadow over the action of the novel. Dickens’s work did often examine poverty as a structural force that restricted and policed the actions of the poor. I keep describing my old research, don’t I? I’m TAing an Ethics in Information Technology course this semester and algorithms and automated systems are one of my favorite topics for discussion. I really want the students to think more carefully about how algorithms are not neutral and they do not spring from the ether. This book is amazing for demonstrating how all these automated systems are structured around a very specific (depressing) view of who the poor are and what they are owed.
