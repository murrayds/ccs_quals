What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?


“This book, then, does not tell the story of a countercultural movement whose ideals and practices were appropriated by the forces of capital, technology and the state. Rather it demonstrates that the New Communalist wing of the counterculture embraced those forces early on and that in subsequent years, Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth network continued to provide the intellectual and practical contexts within which members of the two worlds could come together and legitimate one another’s projects.” (8)
“If the mind was the first site of social change, then information would have to become a key part of a countercultural politics. And if those politics rejected hierarchy, then the circles within circles of information and systems theory might somehow make sense not only as ideas about information, but also as evidence from the natural world for the rightness of collective polity.” (38)
“At one level, then, the Catalog served to make items of use available to an emerging, geographically distributed network of communes. At another, it served as a textual forum within which the back-to-the-landers could need one another, as well as technologists, academics, and artists, and share information. At both of these levels, systems theory become a contact language and a structuring principle.” (78)

What is the main argument of the text?


Turner’s book describes the cultural history of the counterculture movement, the commune movement, cybernetics, technologists and the rise of personal computing, all of which he compellingly argues are linked with a common set of operating philosophies and with a number of players who played major, overlapping roles in all of these groups and movements.  That’s a long sentence, but this book yokes together a lot, and does so rather compellingly. In the introduction, Turner asks how computing technology transformed from a site of anxiety over dehumanization in the clutches of bureaucracy to the utopian tool of personal liberation, and he locates the bridge between these as the countercultural movement, which he argues was tied to research and the emerging informational economy all along. In Turner’s account of the history, the story starts with the interdisciplinary research work of the cyberneticians who described the world in terms of information and feedback loops with a distributed intelligence. These ideas were adopted and built upon by the counter-culture communalists as they emphasized consciousness and collective society’s structure as distributed systems. Turner focuses then on the Whole Earth catalogue as an artifact which he reads as representative of an information systems framing information itself as a tool for building society, and which was intended to facilitate individual liberation by providing small-scale technologies. Personal computing comes in as one of the most powerful as these technologies. Meanwhile, throughout this history, Turner notes the comings and goings and cross-disciplinary collaborations with the members of counter-culture, technologists and capitalists.

 This is a historical text which uncovers and details the various linkages between cybernetic scientists and the counter-cultural movements. Because this is a history of a particular mode of thinking, there are multiple great readings of the ideas in cybernetics (which Norber Weiner was kind enough to write a book about) and of cultural artifacts and practices of the counterculture movement of new communalism, such as the Whole Earth catalogue, and the geodesic dome (that one was particularly fun.

 A few very familiar names popped up in this reading. Turner combines Star and Griesemer’s Boundary object with Gallison’s Trading zone, to create his own brand (pun intended) new concept the Network forum. The boundary object contributes the sense that the Whole Earth catalogue and each of the items in it were being used across different groups for different purposes, all while promoting a kind of cross-discipline exchange, but Turner’s new concept also draws attention to the legitimating power that the kind of cross-valence can lend to the objects and activities of the other group. Geoffrey Bowker also (predictably) makes an appearance in the discussion of the categorization strategies within the catalogue itself.  In itself, From Counterculture to Cyberculture is also valuable for the way that it discusses the cultural underpinnings of the personal computing transformation and the framing of the computer as a liberating technology, where too often the matter of personal computing is accounted for only in terms of the development of the technology. A social history is necessary in this respect, and his argument that the counter-cultural scene was the site of some of this philosophy. However, I would be wary of over-inflating the importance of what was a rather small movement of white men, and it makes me want to read more accounts of other forces that may have been at play in the period from the 1950s to the 1980s.  Additionally, this book also contributes to the work detailing the cybernetics movement and its percolations into wider society—can’t forget that!

Explain how this book may be relevant to your research.


I love a good social history, so it was already fun in that respect. It might be useful when I’m thinking about how interdisciplinary research is justified with ideas about the universality of information that were developed in the cybernetics movement.
