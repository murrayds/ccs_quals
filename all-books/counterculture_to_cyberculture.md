#### Key Concepts
----

1. **Whole Earth Catalog:** A catalog, sort of like an old sears catalog, that was popular among the those in the countercultural movement around the 1960s. This catalog, founded by Stewart Brand, promoted American Indian fashions, self-sufficient living, and cybernetic theory (the last of which emerged directly from the military industrial complex that Brand and others were rebelling against). THis catalog captured the idealism of the early computers and the internet, and as such the community of the catalog ended up forming one of the earliest online communities: WELL. This community eventually lead to Wired magazine. Taken from an online review: “The Catalog aimed to be a comprehensive guide to the products and tools necessary to Communalist living. The bizarre (but by no means arbitrary) range of products on offer included shirts made of Buckskin, table-top calculators and Norbert Wiener’s Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine. The juxtaposition of nature, Eastern philosophy, technology and science in a single discursive space was arguably new, but had its roots in Brand’s personal history as well as in the writings of Wiener, McLuhan and others.”

2. **Network Forum**: A term coined by Turner, meaning a place where members of different communities can come together, exchange ideas, exchange legitimacy (see Bowker & Star), and in the process create new intellectual frameworks and social networks. This concept is intended to bridge the ideas of the “trading zone” (Peter Galison) and the boundary object (James Griesemer). Within a network forum, contributors create new rhetorical tools with which to express and facilitate new collaborations. Other examples of network forums include conferences, think-takes, and open-air markets. Ultimately, the forums themselves often become prototypes of the shared understandings around which they are built. 




#### Questions
----

***What is the main argument of the text?***

This book argues that the romantic, countercultural, utopian culture of the 1960s, with deep suspicions of militarism and modernity, not only emerges in part from the military industrial complex before it, but also connects to the cyberculture movements at the foundation of the construction of the internet. There is no way to separate counterculture from cyberculture, the latter emerged directly from the former. 

In this book, Turner charts the course of the cultural ideals of the so-called counterculture, those originally adopted by the Hippie, New Communalists, and to a lesser extend the New Left after World War II and during the height of the cold war. Turner shows that, perhaps ironically, that while the counterculture movement formed in criticism of the military-industrial complex, many of the ideals of the counterculture in fact stem from military research, and its organization, after World War II. In particular, the ideas of cybernetics is foundational the counterculture, yet was born out of military research (e.g., Norbert Weiner’s work on control systems) and became central to much institutional and military thought at the time. Through cybernetics, the high-tech could meet the spiritual. 

The network linking the 1960s counterculture to the 1990s cyberculture is long and complicated, certainly worth exploring, but also difficult to fully disentangle. Instead, Turner focuses on a single person—Stewart Brand. Brand was a key figure in the counterculture, a founder of the New Earth Catalog which served as a forum for communication for a broad network of people loosely associated with the so-called New Communalist and the then-current counterculture. Brand had also spent his education steeped in cybernetics, which became central in the Whole Earth Catalog, and thus central to the philosophy of the counterculture. Brand continued as a key figure into the new cyberculture, going so far as organizing the first “Hacker’s Conference”. The narrative follows Brand throughout his life and various business ventures, unraveling the transformation from the counterculture of the 1960s to the cyberculture of the 1980s and beyond. 

Turner argues that, after the death of the Whole Earth Catalog and the dissipation of the New Communist movement, that the central ideas of these communities were adopted (or perhaps attached to) the hacker movement (think Richard Stallman, Open Source software, etc.). Stewart Brand was a key figure in this transition, identifying the similarities between his old movement and the hackers of the 1970s. By bridging various communities, as he had done in The Whole Earth Catalog, Brand helped facilitate this transition, eventually founding the Global Business Network and attaching these values to yet another group—corporate leaders and managers. Thus, the counterculture became the cyberculture that went on to become the corporate culture. During this process, an important new symbol emerged—that of the network—a network that characterizes the supposed connectedness of the world and some of the central ideas (such as complexity) inherent to cybernetics. 

For Brand, personal computers would usher in a new breed of direct democracy, connectedness, and personal freedom. However, this movement was also co-opted by right-wing interests, which became clear as soon as Newt Gingrich wonders into the picture as a key proponent of the cybercultural movement. Taken from a review on Goodreads: “The result of all this was that, yes, the digital revolution was always dominated by ideas of self-sufficiency and non-regulation; but it was also always dominated by the welcoming of corporate control and by a generally white male technocratic sensibility, with all the positive and negative connotations those things imply.” Instead of beating the system, they joined it. 

***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***

This book is a history, and so the argument is supported with historical analysis. However, this book is also a history of ideas, which makes is slightly different than others. For example, this book follows characters more than the events or the movements themselves. In Particular, Stewart Brand and his journey through various ventures, as well as the  offer the main support of the arguments of this text. Three such ventures mark the major transitions (at least in the sections that we read)

1. The beginnings of the cybernetics and its early influence both on the extant institutions (military, corporate, etc.) as well as the new countercultural movements (New Communalists, hippies, etc.) embodied in The Whole Earth Catalog. 
2. Brand’s identification of the hacker as the successors to the failed New Communalists, and attachment of the countercultural (and thus cybernetic) ideals onto this group. 
3. Brand’s movement to corporate america, founding the Global Business Network, where he argues that corporate america has become the locus of the early counterculture ideals. 

Throughout, Turner uses the metaphor of the network and networking, both to characterize Brand’s actions to bring together disparate groups, creating “networks”, but also to send home the idea that cybernetics ideas (which often emphasizes connectedness and networks) were inherent to the entire process. 


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

This literature loosely draws upon STS literature, although it does so only a little. The most prominent use of STS is drawing upon Geoffrey Bowker’s ideas of legitimacy exchange and to a lesser extent, Leigh-Star’s boundary objects to illustrate some key points in the early formation of the counterculture and cybernetics movement. Most of the arguments instead draw from primary historical sources. 

This book straddles the line between history of technology and STS (though some might argue that there is no boundary here). It is obviously a history, but a history made to argue the transition of early ideas through american culture, and inevitably into the contemporary times. It also has relevance to the study of the movement of cultural ideas through society. 

***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

The methodology used in the text is historical analysis of primary sources related to the author's main subject: Stewart Brand. The author himself says that Brand is only part of the network of connections and movements that lead the counterculture to the cyberculture, but his role is strong. Moreover, Brand serves as a useful target to follow in order to make sense of the massive network linking the two movements. These sources are largely drawn from Brand’s (and that of the other characteris involved in the narrative) own writings and own ideas. There are some more sweeping statements about movements and time periods that are either backed up by other sources, or left without citation and I hope are statements that Turner’s research gives him the authority to make. 

***Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.***

1. Its a history of science/technology, which is quite relevant to STS in general for showing how cultural ideas originate and transform over time. 
2. It focuses on a particularly interesting subject—cybernetics, and how those ideas that are originally part of science can permeate, sometimes unseen or in a different form, through the wider society. 
3. It also shows the origins of certain movements that are relevant to STS research, particularly the hacker movement and what would eventually becomes the silicon valley tech and open sources cultures. 


***What quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. “This [the hacker] ethic also accorded well with the values espoused in the Whole Earth Catalog. Like the catalog, the hacker ethic suggested that access to tools could change the world, first by changing the individual’s “life for the better” and second, by creating art and beauty. In keeping with the Catalog’s habit of systems thinking, the hacker ethic characterized the tools themselves as prototypes: the computer was a rule-bound system that could serve as a model of the world; to study computers was to learn something about the world at large. Like the Catalog, the hacker ethic suggested that work should be organized in a decentralized manner and that individual ability, rather than credentials obtained from institutions, should determine the nature of one’s work and authority. Finally, it insisted that access to both machines and information should be complete. Like the mystical energy that was supposed to circulate the the communes of the back-to-the-land movement, binding its members to one another, information was to circulate openly through the community of hackers, simultaneously freeing them to act as individuals and binding them in a community of like minds” (pg 135)


2. “In Brand’s account, then, the [MIT] Media Lab became a link in two chains simultaneously: one the chain of cybernetics, strung from the Rad Lab of World War II to the Media Lab of the present, and the other the chain of countercultural revolution, strung from the commune of the 1960s to the computer labs of the 1980s. Brand’s book was infused with the universal rhetorical logic common to both intellectual trajectories. That is, he depicted the Media Lab and its digital technologies, as well as Negroponte [the Media Lab’s leader] ad the corporate and research cultures within which he worked, as prototype of an emerginc socio-technical world” (pg 180)

3. “In the pages of Out of Control, Kelly transformed the New Communalist dream of a rural Eden, of an anti technocratic reintegration with nature, into a celebration of information technology, post-Fordist production practices, and the entrepreneurial engineers, executives, and scientists who watched over both. Like Stewart Brand and his colleagues at the Global Business Network (of which Kelly was a member), Kelly had created a series of overlapping networks: social, technological, informational, and natural. In keeping with the universal rhetorical principles of cybernetics, each network legitimated each other [...] Suddenly mankind had entered a new stage of evolution...” (pg 203) 

4. “By imagining the world as a series of overlapping information systems, and by developing that imagination in particular organizational and media forms, Brand and his Whole Earth colleagues ultimately preserved certain New Communalist ideals long after the movement itself had faded away. They did so by creating a series of forums within which those ideals, and the social networks in which they lived, could be linked to emerging technologies and new centers of economic power.” (pg 250)



#### Relevance to my research
----
It's hard to think of how exactly I might use this book in my work, I tend not to use histories. However, I was particularly interested in the history of ideas related to multidisciplinarity and collaboration which were inherent both to the early counterculture, and well as to modern tech and science work (see the MIT Media Lab, which still seems to function much as its early years, as described by Turner in chapter 6). I am also interested in how these early countercultural and hacker ideals of sharing, open source, etc. were both informed by science and research practices, and how they might have informed the later open-science movements. While I don’t know if I will directly use this book, it was certainly very interesting and gives a lot to think about.  



#### Other Notes

What of other countries? Why is this entirely U.S. centric, why is CERN or France never mentioned, though they would have a direct impact on the formation of the internet of of cyberculture
