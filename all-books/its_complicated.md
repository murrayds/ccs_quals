#### Descriptive Summary


1: Identity
Performance and management of identity
social media facilitates interaction between existing friendships-profiding option for modern teens, whose access to pubic physical space is more limited than ever. 
2: Privacy
au contraire, teens DO care about privacy, but since everything is public by default, privacy looks different and is structured by complex decisions about what and how much to show--often build around assumption that yeah, the posts are there, but people outside that context may not be looking and may not understand context. also social stenography--writing in context-specific code e.g. subtweeting
a lot about how teens avoid nosy parents, who are a very common source of surveillance
privacy has to be negotiated within the constraints of the platform
3: Addiction
thesis--not addicted to tech, more "addicted" to interaction with each other. and the addiction framwork is not useful because it ignores teen agency. This is the chapter that most strongly presents the thesis that teens do social media because they have more limited options for unstructured connection. "As teens seek out new spaces where they have agency adults invent new blocades to restruct youth power. The rhetoric of addiction is one example, a cultural device used to undermine teens' efforts to reclaim a space" (96)
However, counterpoint to boyd--in batting away the addiction narrative so fast, she does not engage with the ways that social media platroms are using strategies to monetize attention and keep people scrolling on their platforms
4: Danger
Moral panic--another way to get scared about teens being on social media
is the parental fear about "bad stuff" online more about trying to limite teens' exposure to others whose interactions they are not able to control?
5: Bullying
cultural handwaving about bullying uses a much too hazy, expansive definition. the definition teens use happens to be very similar to limited academic definition: must be prolongued, repeated, and involve a power differential between bully and victim. moral panic definition can frame all kinds of negative interaction as bullying. Not so. 
the new, strange thing for teens online is the way that the documenting of social dynamics online makes opens these interactions to public consumption. "drama" online as consumption of mild to moderate interpersonal conflict as entertainment. celebrificaiotn--small private citizens can come to resemble small celebrities with following, but without traditional celebrity infrastructure to manage this. 
6: inequality
Biases of techology
Teens reproduce segregated social networks online, Platforms that minoritized groups use tend to be ignored by colleges etc. 
7: literacy
rhetoric of digital natice elides work you must do to learn these complex ways of navigating online
also elides the things that teens do NOT know and understand. e.g. they have little understanding of Google and other platforms ways of working and so receive the information they find there as neutral. unquestioningly inherit assumption that Wikipedia is completely unreliable. Teens still require more education about online structures
Digital native narrative also elides the types of inequities in access to online and ability to navigate online. whether you have your own smartphone etc or if you have to use library computers radically changes modes of using and understanding these technology and the kinds of opportunities for networking afforded to teens. 
8: searching for a public of their own

#### Relevant (analytical/critical) notes

It's easy to read It's Complicated as a work of mythbusting about teens' relationship with online media and platforms: myths like teens are addicted to social media, social media is crawling with predators, teens don't care about privacy and are careless about posting things online. And in some ways, I feel a bit as if she spends a bit too much time doing this--almost like the book keeps getting derailed by the pearl clutching about the internet that boyd then has to address, when she could have been taking on other issues. Anyway, while boyd addresses these concerns, she's more interested in describing the kinds of complex relationships that teens have with online spaces and their pretty sophisticated reasons for spending time online and methods for maintaining their self-presentation online. On the whole though, the kids are alright. In some ways, this need to address these hand-waving fears hampers the books ability to go deeper into the complexities of these issues, as if the book winds up address things that are pretty obvious to us as informatics researchers. However, to be fair, since this book has been massively influential, I also have wondered if the things that seem to be obvious now have become obvious due to boyd's groundbreaking work here. 

boyd describes the social media that teens engage heavily on as networked publics--public spaces that typically easily accessible to teens and unstructured--boyd argues that public spaces for teens to gather informally and interact outside structured environments are becoming increasingly scarce, not least because it's more challenging for teens, as they have limited mobility--not having cars-- and because they are subject to loving parental control and an increasingly full spate of structured tasks; after school activities, lessons, school, jobs, and other responsibilities. Teens structure their social media activities so as to give themselves a space to interact with friends to a greater extent than they're able to do so in person. boyd points to the many times when teens that she's interviewing say that they'd rather interact in person, but that since they can't the social media is a way to expand their social world. While much of the hand-wringing is about "teens disconnecting and preferring computers" boyd argues  that social media for teens is actually another medium for interpersonal connection. 

Within these spaces, teens deploy a variety of oftentimes sophisticated tecnhiques and norms via the various platforms affordances available to them to structure their life online, and to try to make the publics they use take the shape they want them to--basically that's a roundabout way of saying that they try to control who sees what, how they present themselves on each platform so as to fit into the norms of that platform, and how they try in turn to push forward norms on the platforms they use that will work for them and their communities--varying levels of success with each of these, but all this is continuously renegotiated. Much of what teens have to do online is to navigate the different contexts that go along with each platform--through its architecture as a social media site, and through the different groups that they encounter on each site (like the teen who had nerdy friends at school, and he didn't want his family friends commenting on the nerdy posts, but didn't know how to stop it--not wanting to hide, but wanting control over what information appears in what context). Oftentimes, what teens are working on limiting is their parents' ability to surveil them Teens often have different spheres--school, family, different peer sets, that they may try to interact with separately, as each group has different modes of interaction--but while teens can deploy some strategies (like using different platforms for different groups, using built-in privacy settings, complex rules about what to post and what to hold back), they can sometimes not control who and in what context others see their posts. they may not even be aware or thinking specifically about some kinds of groups (like the teen whose profile could be seen by friends of friends, who didn't know that his close friend had friended college recruiters). While boyd details the kinds of complex work that teens do online, she also pushes back against the pervasive idea of the digital native as teens do not really have perfect control over their social networks, and the narrative becomes a way of abdicating the responsibility to educate on the actual dynamics.
