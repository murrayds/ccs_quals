Ruth Schwartz Cowan’s More Work of Mother: The Ironies of Household Technology from the Open Hearth to the Microwave

What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?


“[This book] is a history not just of housework but also of the tools with which that work is done: household technology… Because of our particular set of cultural blinders, we do not ordinarily associate ‘tools’ with ‘women’s work’—but household tools there nonetheless are and always have been….Tools are not passive instruments, confined to doing our bidding, but have a life of their own. Tools set limits on our work…” (9)
“Labor-saving devices were invented and diffused throughout the country during those hundred years that witnessed the first stages of industrialization, but they reorganized the work processes of housework in ways that did not save the labor of the average housewife.” (45)
“The processes of housework had been changed in such a way that that adult males and small children of both sexes were no longer needed to do domestic labor… Men and children could be spared, to the schools, to the factories, to the offices of the burgeoning industrial economy. Adult women and their grown daughters, on the other hand, could not be spared: meals had to be cooked; sick children had to be tended; infants to be nursed; clothes to be made, mended, and laundered---and industrialization had done nothing at all to ease the burden of those particular chores.” (66)

What is the main argument of the text?


In this annotation, I’m choosing to focus on Chapter 3, the 19th century chapter, which covers housework during the early industrial period. Over the course of the chapter, as Cowen describes the types of changes and new tools that arrived, she shows repeatedly that while many of the new technologies have the effect of either easing or doing away entirely with the forms of household labor typically practiced by children and men (the chopping wood or hauling water), the technologies that touched the work performed by women did not actually remove work, but transformed it to something else or created a different set of obligations. In this way, Cowen demonstrates that the development of the separate spheres doctrine, while partly ideological, was also facilitated by a transformation in labor technologies and practices that removed most housework obligations from men and assigned them squarely onto women.

Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.


She opens her chapter with a bevy of primary source quotations from women in a variety of classes who write and speak about being exhausted by an unrelenting set of obligations. Also included are contemporary descriptions of the tiredness of married women from commentators (42-44)
Cowen describes breadmaking, both before and during industrialization in breathtaking detail. Before industrialization, men performed the work of milling course grains into a form that women could cook with, and without tools, women’s baking was largely confined to making quick breads and one-pot meals on the hearth. While these methods were crude and the people’s diets were very uniform from day to day, they were fast they did not take too much labor, and that labor was more evenly distributed between men and women. The changes during industrialization brought advancements like the stove and store-bought white flour, which greatly reduced the labor that men had to do to prepare food—i.e. no more chopping wood or breaking up the grains. However, while the stove allowed for a greater variety of food, women then had to spend more time preparing the greater variety of food that the stove allowed, and the more labor-intensive art of bread-making.
Chapter 3 also includes one of Cowan’s excellent photo essays uses a set of ordered period photographs, drawings and advertisements to illustrate the historical conditions that she’s discussing using real artifacts of the time.

Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.


More Work for Mother is unmistakably a history of technology AND gender, and it powerfully demonstrates the ways that technology is entwined with how societies have constructed gender. In this way, as histories of technology all too often seem to forget that women exist or have any relation to technology, this was an important contribution.

Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.


It seems to me that Cowen works most often and most powerfully with examples, both real and speculative. She has exhaustively researched historical descriptions of the prices, uses and usage of common household products, objects and technologies to provide empirical evidence for her claims (we can say that when writing about histories, right? empirical? anyway). But to animate this evidence, she draws these intimate descriptions of how a hypothetical woman might perform a particular task—this is what I mean by “speculative examples.” As an example of this, take the narrative about how a stew might be prepared on page 45.

Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.


Cowan’s focus on household tools is in itself a major claim as she draws attention to how the development and widespread adoption of household tools solidified not only how that labor is structured but how we understand the roles of women and their work. Her discussion of tools as objects with some kind of active social power seems to also tie into the types of actor-network theories that we seem so fond of. I think that it’s valuable to talk about the socio-political lives of objects and technologies.

Explain how this book may be relevant to your research.


Much of my previous work in the English department focused on the Victorian period, and I’m still fascinated by discussions and work about the 19th century. I’ve read a lot of discussion about the doctrine of separate spheres, but I’ve only ever heard it treated as an ideological/social phenomenon. It has been fascinating to read Cowen illuminate its technological underpinnings as well.
