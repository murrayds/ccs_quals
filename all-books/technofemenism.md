#### Key Concepts
----

1. **Technofemenism:** This view of feminism bridges the divide between essentialist techno-pessimistic feminist literature, and the apolitical and deterministic techno-utopian literature. Technofeminism argues that gender and technology are mutually constructive, in that they shape one another. This viewpoint sees technological change as highly contingent and heterogeneous, and allows scholars to locate technological change in winder social netowrks (see Actor Network Theory). In doing so, this perspective provides space for women's agency, and so offers a path toward liberation through emancipatory politics. Quoting the last sentence of the book: "the promist of technofeminism, then, is twofold. It offers a different way of understanding the nature of agency and change in a post-industrial world, as well as the means of making a difference" (pg 130). 
2. **Cyborg:** An ambiguous, satirical, femenist myth constructed by Donna Harraway. Many previous imaginings of femeninity have focused on the idea of a "natural godess" that is pure and close to nature. Donna Harraway rejects this imagining as gender essentialist, and instead invokes the image of the cyborg, am impure cybernetic organism. Harraway argues that new technologies, by creaitng "cyborgs", break down rigid boundaries like those between human and animal, or between animals and machine. By breaking down boundaries, Harraway argues that new technologies can also break down gender divisions, finally empowering and liberating women (or creating a world without gender). To quote: "...the cyborg creature fundamentally redefines what it is to be human, and thus can potentially exist in a world without gender categories. For Haraway, rupturing the ontological divide between living organisms and dead artefacts necessarily challenges gender dualisms". 


#### Questions

***What is the main argument of the text?***

This book charts the history of feminist though regarding technology, summarizing the conflict between techno-utopian and techno-pessimimistic literature. The early days of feminist literature viewed technology as inherently patriarchical, and thus anathema to femenine empowerment—these scholars argued that the qualities of women made them more caring, closer to nature, and more apart from the masculine "industrial" society. However, Wajcman explains that these scholars also tended towards gender essentialism, ascribing inherent qualities to women and femeninity that were later critiqued. The following feminist literature instead took on a more techno-utopian perspective. They argues that whereas technology had, up until then, been patriarchical, that this was not an inherent quality of technology, and that new technologies had the potential to liberate women. These scholars (among them Harraway and Plant) cited the Pill as evidence of biomedical technology empowering women, and virtual communiteis as spaces where women could escape oppresive stereotypes. However, Wajcman also argues that this utopianism is apolitical, giving importance to technology without directly challenging social structure, and does not offer the tools for women's empowerment. Moreover, Wajcman argues that each of these perspectives frame technology as deterministic, and ignore their cultural and political dimensions. 

Wajcman proposes a new brand of femenism that she brands *technofemenism*. This kind of femenism bridges the pessimistic and utopian visions of technology, arguing for a *mutual shaping* perspective. Under this perspective, gender and technology are not separate, but shape one another, and the benefits or consequences of technology depend on the context of its creation and use. Studies of technology and gender should not only study the technology, but also women's lives. The technofemenistic perspective also argues that absense of women dos not equate to "gender-free"—analyses of technology should consider the roles of men and women among the designers, manufactureres, salesman, executives, and users involved in the lifecycle of technology. 


By recognizing the cultural dimensions of technology, this perspective also empowers women by demonstrating that technology, by itself, will not liberate women. Instead, liberation will come through political action. 

***Describe the structure of the main argument of the text.***
The chapters of the book follow the discussions of feminism and technology, generally chronologically. After the introduction, Wajcman focuses on the early scholarship on the role of gender in technology, summarizing the techno-pessimistic ideas at the height of industrialization that highlighted the male-dominance of technology and argued that technology was inherently patriarchical. 

Following this, Wajcman discusses teh birth of the social shaping, or constructivist literature. She uses as an example the microwave, a product originally dsigned for men, but was later successfully marketed towards women. This perspective highlighted that technology was not fixed, and is instead shaped by the many choices of actors involved in the design, commercialization, and use of that technology. Different groups have different meanings for technology, which can then radically alter the meaning and course of technological development. This perspective gave hope that technology could be used to liberate women.

In the next chaper, Wajcman begins to discuss the scholarship and technology at the beginnigs of the internet. In reponse to earlier technological-pessimism, feminist scholars argued that the internet had the potential to liberate women by giving them new opportunities in a space more fit for women than men. However, Wajcman contrasts this with the heavily masculine culture of early "hacker" culture and technology companies. She follows in the same chapter with a discussion of the feminist promises of cyberspace, spearheaded by Sadie Plant. This movement, called *cyberfeminism* offered exciting possibilities to women, while giving them the agency and control that second-wave feminism ignored by portraying women as passive victims. However, Wajcman argues that cyberfeminism presents a utopian vision of technology that doesn't match the reality of technology, and which doesn't consider the role of humans in emanicpatory politics. 

In chapter four, Wajcman summarizes the works of Donna Haraway by discissing her evocative idea the *cyborg*—an ambiguious entity blending human and machine which by its very existence breaks down boundaries and traditional dualisms. Haraway offered another utopian imagining of technology, though one which was careful of the contextual and constructivisit nature of gender and technology. In short, Haraway believed that cyborgs, faciliated by new biomedical and information technology, would break down gender dualisms and libearate women by making a genderless world. Wajcman argues that while this is an evocative idea, it still tends towards technological utopianism and ignores the political work necessary to make positive change. 

In the final chapter Wajcman argues that scholars of gender and technology should follow the *technofeminist* approach, one which bridges technological pessimism and utopianism and which allows for analysis of the political, social, and cultural elements of technological development. 


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

Wajcman pulls from a variety of literature, including Ruth Schwartz Cowan, Donna Haraway, Sadie Plant Sherry Turkle, and more. The particular disciplines of these literature is heterogeneous, but they can roughly be filed under the name "feminist" literature in STS. This is also the field that this literature contributes to.

The main contribution of this text is twofold:

1. First, this book offers a brief summarization of the history of feminist debate as it relates to technology. In this way, this book serves as a strong introduction or review to this literature
2. The other conribution of this book comes from the argument for *technofeminism* as a solution to the debates in feminist literature and as a potential path forward for feminist scholarship. 

***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

This is primairly a theoretical book which summarizes scholarly works in feminist and STS literature. Apart from literature review, there do not appear to be any systematic methodology. 


***Describe how this text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.***

This book summairze the feminist literature that relates to technology and in doing so, she charts discussions that occured within or tangential to mainstram STS literature. Gender and technology is of direct interest to STS—many scholars in this field come form a gender studies background, or from fields like anthropology which often draw from feminist literature. More specifically, the following themes/topics are of interest to STS:

1. The history of thought in STS and feminist literature, citing famous authors from a range of fields.
2. The apparent duality between techno-pessimistic and techno-utopian literature, and the way in which discussion of these sides progressed. 
3. The introduction of *technofeminism*, and discussion if the role of politics and culture in the mutually-constructive shaping of gender and technolgy. 

In addition to these main themes, Wajcman provides various examples of interest to STS authors, such as the OncoMouse, the case of the feminization of the microwave and typewriter, and virtual communities. 


***What quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. "Gender was shown time and time again to be an important factor in shaping the organization of work that results from technological change. Further, men's traditional monopoly of technology has been identified as key to maintaining the definintion of skilled work as men's work. The association between technology, masculinity, and the very notion of what constitutes skilled work is still fundamental to the way in which the gender division of labour is being reproduced today" (pg 27). 

2. "technology must be understood as part of the social fabric that hlds society together; it is never merely technical or social. Rather, technology is always a socia-material product—a seamless web or network combining artefacts, people, organizations, cultural meanings, and knowledge. It follows that technological change is a contingent and heterogeneous process in which technology and society are mutually constructed" (pg 106)

3. "If the gendered self is 'an assemblage of materials', then women's emancipation requires changing the women-machine relationship to enhance women's capacity for initiatives over machines. In other words, all these streams of argument strengthen the need for women's greater appropriation of tools and technical expertise. Our interest here is the way in which some men can effectively deploy their technical and bodily capital to control technology, and the way in which male bodily capital can become embodied in technology...by linking gender and technology, technofemenist perspectives add a new dimension to sociological analyses of gender difference and secual inequality" (pg 117)

4. "The femenistic project is incomplete, and some, as we have seen, have resopnsed to the distance we have yet to travel with the kind of pessimism that fosters an essentialist view of technolgy and its gendered power relations. Cyberfemenists have taken a utopian position, looking to new technologies as in themselves transformative. The problem with both positions is that they assign too much agency to new technology, and not enough to feminist politics. Technofemenism is grounded in the udnerstanding that only we can free ourselves. This makes a feminist politics both possible and necessary. Feminist politics has made a diference, and we can build upon the difference it has made. We do not live in a world that is post-feminist, but we do live in a world that feminism has shaped and will continue to shape" (pg 128)

#### Other Notes
----
I am interesed in fitting this work in with others that we have read. For one, Dr. Wajcman frames the car as a liberating force for women, whereas Cowan's *More work for Mother* instead frames it as a factor in women's continuing domestic labor. Wajcman also argues that online tools offer a way for social movements to form and mobilize, however this is at odds with Siva's *Antisocial Media* which argues what is nearly the opposite.
