Sherry Turkle’s The Second Self, Chapters 4-6
	1. 
What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?


"Adolescents use many different types of materials to construct their sense of identity. There is an obvious way in which computers can become part of this process... We begin to see examples of "working through" in elementary school-age children. In the course of learning to program they are grappling with issues that go beyond mastery and competence. Computer programming helps shape their feelings about what kind of person they are... (138)
“What joined the first generation of personal computer owners into a culture was not only that they used the same hardware, read the same magazines...They shared a quality of relationship with the computer, an aesthetic of using the computer for transparent understanding.” (166)

What is the main argument of the text?


Turkle’s book describes the many types of relationships people develop with their computers, with thoroughness and depth, as she works to develop an understanding of how these relationships function for the people who enjoy them. She starts in childhood in the earlier chapters discussing the activities children perform on computers, and subsequent chapters 4 through 6 focus on adolescents, adults with personal computers, and members of hacker culture respectively. In each of these groups, Turkle finds that working with computing, interfacing with computers informs aspects of people’s identities, and she pays particular attention to the types of computer activities that members of each group find particularly absorbing. Turkle seems especially interested in narratives of people apparently missing some element in their lives fill in that need through some kind of activity with computers. For example, in the example of Deborah in Chapter 4, Deborah is a young girl who describes herself struggling with self-control, but when she begins using programming to draw graphics, her work with computing comes to symbolize a form of control that she can hold. I’m still trying to figure out how fair this observation is, but it does seem to me to be a pattern.

Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported./ 5. Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument


Turkle’s methodology seems to be very strongly focused on interviewing and participant observation to some extent as she works to describe the lives of the people she talks to within the chapters. Each chapter could be described as a series of profiles of various people’s experiences with computing. However, along the way, Turkle also deftly advances a series of more general theories about interactions with computing, using each profile to illuminate a different piece. I think there could also be some elements of Turkle close-reading the programming outputs of the people she talks to, because with each interview, she ties in more description of what the person’s choice of project reveals about them.
	1. 
Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text. / 6. Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.


I’m not sure yet if Turkle’s work qualifies as ethnography because the discussions and interviews with the various people in her book are not necessarily part of a cohesive community, say of a particular culture of middle-schoolers who work with computers. The chapter about hacker culture seems to approach being an ethnography more than the other chapters, but because I still don’t know too much about ethnography, I’m not entirely sure yet. I’ll see what everyone in class says tomorrow, and probably amend my read here.
There are so many STS books about hackers and hacker culture, including one of last week’s reading From Computer Culture to Counterculture. It’s also easy to tell that The Second Self can also be connected very easily with HCI, and I really can’t wait to hear more about what the HCI researchers in class think about this book. Is The Second Self an accepted text that is commonly referred to in HCI? Is it not actually identified with the field?

Explain how this book may be relevant to your research.


The Second Self could be useful for thinking through the vast variety of computing uses. The book shines a light on the ways that computings meanings have been socially constructed and tied up with the self.
