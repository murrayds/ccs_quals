#### Key Concepts
----

1. ***Evocative object:*** An good object that we think with. Turkle argues that computers are strong evocative objects, meaning that people can use computers as a mental model with which to think about themselves, their relationships, and the world. This is due in part to the “psychological” properties of computers, being “machines that think”. This is made apparent by the ease by which computational concepts have entered common language and the impact that computers have had on culture (visible even when this book was written, decades ago). Turkle uses this concept to explore children’s development and later to explore various computer subcultures. 

2. ***Marginal object:*** an object that have no clear space. For example, computers are an object: they are a “thing”, yet they are “think” like a human. Another example would be a clown: simultaneously a person of amusement and a madman. These objects tend to sit on the line between categories. Turkle claims that “marginal objects are not neutral presences. They upset us because they have no home and because they often touch on highly charged issues of transition”. Computers especially touch on one sticky subject: “what it means to be alive”, as well as morality, emotions, etc. (see the infinite number of AI movies and books). Turkle also argues that this marginality is what draws us to computers, because we are drawn to what frightens us, and we play we what disturbs us, in part to reassert control over it. 

3. ***Rorschach effect:*** Rorschach (inkblots) images are said to take on different meanings depending on the preconceptions and ideas of the viewer. Similarly. Turkle argues that computers take on different kinds of meaning and significance based on the viewer. As such, computers offer a strong projective medium, a way for the user to project their desires and ideas, projections that speak to their personalities and concerns. 


#### Questions
----

***What is the main argument of the text?***

Turkle argues that people’s interactions with computers is giving rise to new forms of culture and psychology in humans. Computers are so-called marginal objects because while they are material things yet resemble life more than most other inanimate things. Their interactivity raises issues and opportunities for discourses of philosophy of the mind (is it alive?), on identity (“technical” vs. non-technical” people) and culture (hacker cultures). These machines have thus moved beyond simple tools and are instead essential part of our lives, “intimate” machines. Turkle writes about how ideas from computation impact children’s development and challenge common conceptions of aliveness, the self, morality, and more. Moreover, she demonstrates the cultural impact that computers have had, with computational concepts being adopted into language, particularly language related to psychology and the mind. She also spends time discussing how computers affect our sense of being alone, our sense of control, and more, by examining a range of characters. 

***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***

Turkle relies on interviews with a series of different people in order to make her arguments about the strange and novel psychological and cultural phenomenon brought about my personal computers. In the chapters we read, she pulls from three main groups to illustrate her points,

1. Turkle interviews children, usually between the ages of 4 and 6 or so, and both asks and observes how they grapple with ideas of the mind made prominent by computers. Computers upset the balance that children have traditionally drawn between “life” and “not life”, and as such these children produce intriguing philosophical arguments in an attempt to draw such a distinction. Even at a young age, the presence of computers and “animate objects” has an effect on children, and frames these children’s discourses on the mind. 

2. The next chapters focus on adolescence rather than children, interviewing children more often aged between 12 and 20. These children are not worried about drawing distinctions between things and making sense of the world, but more so with making sense of themselves (identity) and the beginnings of “controlling” or “mastering” the world. These kids begin to incorporate computers as part of their identity, affiliating themselves as “technical” or “non-technical” people. Some of these children also express themselves in various ways through computers, and through this mastery reveal aspects of their identity. 

3. The third major group investigated by Turke (at least in chosen sections) is that of so-called hackers. This group identifies most strongly not only with computers, but with mastery. Computers offer limitless opportunities for mastery and are largely devoid of risk, providing an outlet for feelings of control and safety. The hackers becomes a culture in and of themselves, alone from much of the “physical world” but not necessarily alone mentally, communicating between themselves and sharing a set of values and norms between them.


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

This text was written several decades ago and thus many of the the “STS” literature which we may think of as related isn’t around to cite. Turkle received a doctorate in “Sociology and Personality Psychology” ’ and so it is clear that she is approaching her study from the perspective of a sociologist. However her career since then illustrates what disciplines she actually contributed to.Turkle is now the head (and founder) of the MIT department of STS, indicating that she has been picked up largely by the STS community. Indeed, this book has been cited far and wide, even by Kentaro Toyama, the author of Geek Heresy, who fashions himself more of a tech insider. 

***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

The primary methodology used in this text is that of the interview. All of the instights are drawn from thousands of interviews that Turkle conducted with children, adolescents, scientists, engineers, and many others over the course of six years. She however doesn’t take these interviews at face value—she analyzes them, draws out important implicit ideas, sometimes even contradicting the speaker. This method allows Turkle ask questions about culture, computers, the mind, and identity without ever really having to define these terms—she simply lets the interviewees express what they feel about these topics. It also has the advantage of allowing Turkle to discuss big, social phenomenon through the lens of individuals. 

Interestingly, much of Turkles analysis (and perhaps approach during interviews) draws from a Psychoanalytic tradition. This is in part likely the result of Turkle’s own background as in the field, but it also allows Turkle to dive (too?) deep into some of the interviewee’s thoughts and statements, weaving a provocative narrative. 

***Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.***

- Computers are technology. Perhaps one of the most significant technologies of the past decades as they have entered into everyday life and discourse. As such, any study of computers falls within the realm of STS
- This text also links to society in interesting ways, exploring the individual-level thoughts and feelings of people grappling with computers in their life, and then linking these insights to culture and society as a whole. Her analysis is cultural, specifically exploring the intersection between culture and technology.
- I think that there is also something relevant about how Turkle spend times on how people develop with technologies, and how these technologies impact their identities and ideas. 

***What quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. “Technology catalyzes changes not only in what we do but in how we think. It changes people’s awareness of themselves, of one another, of their relationship with the world. The new machine that stands behind the flashing digital signal, unlike the clock, telescope, or the train, is a machine that “thinks”. It challenges our notions not only of time and distance, but of mind.” (pg 19)

2. “Traditionally, children came to define what was special about people in contrast to their nearest neighbors, their pet dogs, cats, and horses. [...] Computer upset the traditional scenario. First, they upset the distinction between things and people; it can no longer be simply the physical as opposed to the psychological. The computer too seems to have a psychology‚it is a thing that is not quite a thing, a mind that is not quite a mind. And then they upset the way children perceive their “nearest neighbors”.[...] What is special about computers must be what makes them different from computers [...] Emotion is the psychological quality most frequently used to separate the human from the machine. But it is not the only one” (pg 62)

3. “George, like Dennis and Carla, had stumbled on another language of self-reference, a computational language. They have not picked up their ideas through the diffusion of theories about mind as program. Their ideas have been sparked by interaction with the machine itself. The computer is enough like a mind to make analogies between the self and the program seem plausible...They are not concerned with whether computers might one day be like people; instead they are stuck with the idea that their mins have something in common with the "mind” of the computer before them. Whether or not computer scientists ever create an artificial intelligence that can think like a person, computers change the way people think—especially about themselves” (pg 152)

4. “We are surrounded by machines. We depend on them. We are frightened by how powerful they have become. Our nuclear machines have the power to destroy the wolf. We are suspicious of the new “psychological machines” and feat the hacker’s intimate relationship with his object. Its control over hum is disturbing because we too feel controlled. We fear his sense of becoming a “device” because most of us to, to one extent or another, have had that feeling. We fear his use of the machine as a safe companion because we, to, can feel its seduction.” (pg 218)



#### Relevance to my research
----
This book is interesting to me on a personal level, because I had a bit of exposure to the so-called “hacker culture” in undergrad. Also, some of the issues of control, safety, etc. which Turkle mentioned played an important role to why I turned to studying computer science (but also why I wanted to leave). 

For my research, the connections are less obvious. I believe the sections on hackers do illustrate some of the divide in science between the “scientific” and the “technical” (which was also made apparent in Seeing Like a Rover. I think there is also something to this idea of mastery that pervades science, especially the biosciences, where the overworked lab worker with poor hygiene is common, but seemingly much less “heroic” than the hacker. There is also probably a connection that could be made in exploring the spread of technical and computer-based “identities” throughout research, bringing new fields such as computational biology, digital humanities, and music informatics; is this a signal of computer and technology becoming normalized, or is there something else going on here?

I will need to think about this one more in order to make stronger and more useful connections, though I know they certainly exist.


#### Other Notes
----
I'm interested in the "psychoanalyst" approach of this book—is this seen as a strength or the book, or a weakness? Maybe there were things that were either gained or lost by taking this approach?

I also find it amusing both the extent to which this book has aged, and the extent to which it hasn't. The fundamentals of computers and our relationship to them are mostly the same, but many of the details are so distant. Even the details in the 2005 prologue, only a decade and a half old, are still in valuable.
