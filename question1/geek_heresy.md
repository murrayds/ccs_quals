#### Key Concepts
----

1. **Law of Amplification:** This is the idea, not coined by Toyama but devleoped and extensively used, that technology serves as merely an amplifier of already-existing human behaviours. Technology amplifies both good and bad behaviors. A good teacher given a smart-board will put it to use. A bad student given a laptop will use it to play games. This idea is used to reconcile the effect of technology from a social determinist perspective—technology is never the cause of behavior, just an amplifier.
2. **Packaged Interventions:** Toyama uses this idea to discuss ready-made solutions to provlems that are advertised as able to make improvements when deployed to any context. For example, a "laptop for every kid" is a packaged intervention—it promises radical improvements with relatively little investmenet, promises to provide knowledge access and enlightment to all, and promises to do so anywhere. However, as Toyama shows, this intervention is often lacking—laptops are rarely an improvement to education, and only succeed when there are good teachers and resources to take advantage of them. In a sense, packaged interventions are any intervention that don't focus on addressing the human-causes of social issues. 
3. **Intrinsic Development:** Often referred to as the development "heart, mind, and will", which Toyama uses "intrinsic development" to refer to the virtues that should be cultivated in individuals. Heart referes to intention, i.e., does someone want to work for the benefit of others (good), or their own personal gain (bad); mind refers to discernment or ability to make use of knowledge, i.e., does someone follow sound medical advice on vaccincations (good), or follow poor advice about vaccines and autism (bad); will refers mostly to "grit", "follow-through", "persavearence", and other such ideas, i.e., will someone actuall commit to an exercise regiment (good), or continue a sedentary lifestyle (bad). Toyama argues that international development should prioritize the intrinsic development of people, rather than on fixing external factors. 

#### Questions
----

***What is the main argument of the text?***

This text is more or less a counter argument to tech utopianism, the belief the technology will solve the world's problems. Rather, Toyama takes the perspective of a social determinist, arguing that all problems are only human problems, and that technology can only ever amplify existing human behaviours, whether those behavious be good or bad. His arguments follow a contrary approach: he doesn't follow the economics trend of simplification, nor does he use the deeply (perhaps too deep?) contextual approach of anthropology. Suprisingly little of the book is about technology, with the former half discussing some technical interventions and the latter half turning to Toyama's experience and views with internaitonal development.  

The first part of the book serves as a debunking of tech. utopianism, wherein Toyama draws on his experience as a tech insider (researcher/developer at Microsoft) and an educator in India and Ghana. He argues that technology has never solved any of the problems's he has seen; instead, improvement came with the help of dedicated and passionate teachers, administrators, workers, and more. Technology simply amplified the good qualities of these already good people. Toyama argues that technologies often serve as packaged interventions—something that can be moved freely between contexts with the promise of improvements. However, Toyama shows that this is not the case—packaged interventions only work when the implementers are passionate and dedicated; in other cases, packaged inerventions are either useless, harmful, or at most marginally useful. 

The second part of the book transitions to what amounts to Toyama's views on international development and education. Toyama argues that real change comes not from packaged interventions, technology, or even really any technocratic intervention. Instead, Toyama argues for the cultivation of "heart, mind, and will" in individuals, which Toyama packages into the term "intrinsic development". He argues that national development comes from changes in individual aspirations and capacities. This view seems to in-part reconcile individualistic and collectivist views of society, and has the following general flow of though:

- people are different, and not everyone is equally good 
- "Heart, mind, and will" make people more good 
- Countires which have invested in heart, mind, and will have, over time, become more economically prosperous, free of corruption, just, and egalitarian
- However, not everyone has had the chance or opportunities to cultivate these traits, often due to external issues (poverty, parenting, corruption, etc.). Moreover, humans tend not to naturally pursue intrinsic development (i.e.: children want to play games, not listen to class)
- As such, successful programs must work to cultivate heart, mind in the people they are trying to help.
- This can only happen through Mentorship: mentorship during education and guidance as an adult

The second half is certaintly interesting, and I certaintly found it to be interesting and a novel perspective that I am, mostly, on board with. However, this latter half is certaintly not an academic piece, and draws heavily on Toyama's personal beliefs, though these beliefs are drawn heavily from experience. 

***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***
 
Toyama largely draws on personal experiences to support his point. And his experience is extensive. Currently a professor at Univeristy of Mich., Toyama has a PhD in Computer Science and has worked at Microsoft for a great deal of time, which eventually lead him to work as a teacher (still affiliated with Microsoft)in India and Africa. 

The first part of the book largely draws on Toyama's experiences in these educational settings. He tells of how his initial excitement over the power of technology was misplaced. One example was MultiPoint: a simple application that allowed many children to hook a mouse into a single computer, allowing students to be engaged during computer-based lessons. However, Toyama argues that while this brought some improvement, it didn't always generalize to other contexts, and didn't cause any major improvements in children's education. He even studies Randomised Control Trials (RCTs), the gold-standard of educational and development interventions, but argues how RCTs can be inadequate for answering large complex questions and often produce marginally-useful infomraiton. 

Toyama also spends a great deal of time discussing a fair number of educational institutions, such as Ashesi University in Ghana, a univeristy that has devoted resources to training "heart, mind, and will" as Toyama puts it, and thus is investing in Africa's future. Another institution was Shanti Bhavan, a boarding school in India which enrolled children of poor and rural families and spent years cultivating virtuous traits and providing them with close mentorship. Toyama argues that each of these institutions have had imense positive impacts on the intrisic growth of their students. Moreover, these institutions didn't succeed by using fancy technologies, but rather by having dedicated staff and 

The latter half of the book continues to draw on personal experience, largely focusing on the hard-working individuals that he has met throughout his life and highlighting how their intrinsic development has contirbuted to their maturation and their turn towards socially-beneficial work, rather than just work for survival, money, or recognition.


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

Toyama offers passing references to STS scholars (Latour, Turkle, etc.), economists, anthropologists, and people whom I assume are active in the field of ICT4D.

***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

This book is based almost entirely on Toyama's personal experiences as a researcher, engineer, and a teacher, and not on a systematic methodology. He draws from personal anecdotes and the experiences of people he met along the way. As such, I don't know if this book has a "methodology" to speak of. 
 

***Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.***

1. For one, STS is connected to the field of ICT4D; information technology are a huge interest to STS scholars, and their application to different contexts even more so.   
2. Toyama offers a contrary view to many STS scholars; instead of being in the "mutual shaping" camp that we find most STS people, Toyama instead argues in social determinism, that technology only serves to amplify existing human behaviors. 
3. THe first half of the book largely focuses on theoretical concepts such as the Law of Amplification and Packaged interventions—I beleive that each of these concepts would be useful to discussions in STS. 


***What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. "Context definintely matters. All three factors, though, point to *human* context as what matters most. Or, to put it another way, the technology isn't the deciding factor even in a technology project. Of course, good design trumps poor design, but beyong some level of functionality, technical design matters much less than the human elements. The right people can work around a bad technology, but the wrong people will mess up even a good one" (pg 26)

2. "Of course, technologies *can* enrich lives. Voting *can* empower citizens; and microcredit *can* lead to better livelihoods. But "can" is not always "will". Modern society fetishizes technocratic devices, but it's a human finger in the on-switch and a human hand on the controls" (pg 73)

2. "Again, its not that technology, packaged interventions, RCTs, social enterprises, happiness, scalability, measurability, and technocratic ideas in general are bad in and of themselves. Rather, the trouoble is cultism and imbalance. New vaccines are good, but not while heal-care sysems go unfunded. Educational technology might be helpful, but not if good teachers and institutional support are lacking. Elections are great, but not if social norms and government institutions don't support democracy. Technocratic means might be part of the solution, but with so much attention on them, who's working on the other parts?" (pg 99)

4. "Technology amplifies preexisting differences in wealth and achievement. Children with greater vocabularies ger more out of Wikipedia. Students with behavioral challenges ar emore distracted by video games. Rich parents will pay for tutors so that their children can learn to program the devices that others merely learn to use. Technology at school may level the playing field of access, but a level field does nothing to improve the skill of the players, which is teh whole point of education. Technology by itself only increeases the gap between the haves and have-nots" (pg 117)



#### Relevance to my research
----

I think that I can make use of the ideas of the "Law of amplification" and "packaged interventions" in my research. I think that Data Science offers an interesting case study for this, because it is often treated as a packaged intervention. Companies and institutions hire institutions hoping for some sort of magic to happen. However, the "magic", if it happens, is not really magic at all. Instead, following Toyama's arguments, the data science will simply amplify existing behaviors of the organization. So what does Data Science amplify? Does is amplify decision-making? human's need for classification/labeling? something else? Food for thought.s

I am perosnally somewhat (though not entirely) fond of some of Toyama's ideas in the latter half of the book. I think that his philosophies serve as an interesting blend of Western focus on individualism and agency, with the more "Eastern" focus on personal virtue, community, and intrinsic development.
