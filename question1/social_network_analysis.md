***What is the main argument of the text?***

In his book, Freeman outlines the history of the field of Social Network Analysis, a field with conceptual simialrities to some of the structuralist ideas of Compte, but which has experienced a long and circuitious path to its current prominence in research. Freeman argues that modern social network analysis is characterized by four features: 

1. Social network analysis is motivated by a structural intuition based on ties linking social actors
2. It is gorunded in systematic empirical data
3. It draws heavily on graphic imagery
4. It relied on the use of mathematical and/or computational models

Freeman traces the history of network analysis, identifying its birth in the 1930's, the first iteration in which all of these four features were present. He then progresses through the multiple births and deaths of social network analysis, charting the characters and traditions of network analysis through the 40's, into and throughout the "dark ages" of social netowrk analysis in the 50's, 60's, and 70's, and culminating in the resurgence of social network analysis under the direction of Harrison White in the 1980's. 

This book is quite meta, as it is a book about social network analysis authored by a social network analyst that follows a social network analysis approach to history. Apart from forming an interesting narrative, this appraoch also highlights the role that individuals have in shaping and developing research paradigms: one particularly interesting character, Moreno, made key contributions to the field, but due in part to his strange and caustic personality, these ideas were not adopted by the wider scientific community. By contrast, Freeman shows how Harrison White, as a result of his charisma, was able to enlist the help of colleagues, students, and post-docs, and in so doing, fomented a new generation of network scientists. 

One interesting finding of his analysis is that Social Netowrk Analysis is a fairly integrated field: sociologists of science like Kuhn imagine disciplines partitoned into  adversarial and bickering "schools", but little of the sort happened in social network analysis. Instead, the field is mostly collaborative and maintains a firm consensus. This is in part due to the mathematical nature of the discipline, but also due to the integrative work done by many individuals and organizations. 

***Describe at least three ways that the main argument is supported.***

The arguemtn of this book seems to be that Social Network analysis has a long and interesting history that never manifested in a large and vibrant discipline until it was adopted by a broad range of researchers. He supports his claims by examining teh conditions in which this discipline was birthed in the 1930s, and how these circumstances eventually lead to the field being largely abandoned. Simiarly, he shows that through the "dark ages" of social netowrk analysis, that actions to maintain and revive the field were largely unsuccessful. He shows that it wasn't until Harrison White that the field truly thrived. In conducting his analysis, Freeman implicitely argues for the importance of the human, individual people and their social connections, in shaping scientific disciplines. He goes further to dsicuss how the particular social structurs and relationships of Social Network Analysis have been shaped by the work of many people and organizations. 


***Describe the main literatures that the text draws on and contributes to, and the particular contribution made by the text.***

Linton Freeman is primarily a sociologist, and at that, he is a social network analyst. The most obvious field that this book contributes to is Social Netowrk Analysis, to which it offers a meta-commentary on the field and its history.

More broadly, this book sits within the sociology of science (as mentioned in the book's subtitle), so this would be the next most obvious field that it cotributes to. The prime contribution to this area is the "social network" approach to the hisotry and sociology of science, which highlights the importance of social relationships to mediating scientific work. This book also offers a competing vision of the formation of scientific disciplines to that espoused by Kuhn. Thanks to the integrative work of many, social netowrk analysis is a largely unified field that has not divided into disparate and bickering schools, and imagined by Kuhn, and as seemingly apparent in much of the social sciences. 

***Describe the methodology (or methodologies) used in the text, and how it enables the author(s) to support the text’s main argument.***

Freeman draws primarily on a mix of historical analysis of academic documents and perosnal expeirence. His background as a social network analysis provides him with a unique internal perspective of the field and its history. He complements this with analysis of scholarly works, discussions with colleagues, and what appear to be the results of archival searches. 

***Describe at least three of the text’s themes or topics that are of general interest in STS.***

History of science is a broad sub-discipline of science and technology studies—due to its methodological and topical contributions to the history of science, this book is made relevant to science and technology studies. In addition to charting the course of social netowrk analysis, this book more prominently investigates the adoption of structuralist intuitions in the social sciences.

The contrast of characters like Harrison White and Moreno also higlight the importnace of the individual, and individual's personalities, to the development of scientific knowledge and the adoption of disciplines.

One other interesitng idea is that of "integrative work", the work done by people to build consensus across a discipline and foster a broad community. Most sociologists of science and STS people I have read have tended to speak of sientific knoweldge as something that is produced through competition, controversy, and political force. However, Freeman offers a glimpse into how integrative work can build broad consensus even among a large diverse and disparate group of researchers. 


***What three quotes capture the critical significance of the text?***

1. "I need to stress that this book is no intended as an intellectual history of social netowrk analysis. It is, rather, an exploration of the field from a sociology of science perspective. I am convinced that the patterning of links among the people who were involved in the development of the field—its social network—is key to understanding how and why it emerged. So I have tried to reconstruct those patterns[...] Thus, this is a history of social network analysis written from a social network perspective" (pg 9)

2. "The overall pattern, then, seems to be one in which each succeeding contribution introduced a new segment of the social science community to the structural perspective. But, at the end of the 1960s, no version of network analysis was yet universally recognized as providing a general paradigm for social research. By then, however, the broad community of people engaged in social research were ready to embrace a structural paradigm. It was in this setting that **Harrison White** and his students began their structural work" (pg 120)

3. "Beyond this mathematical precision, the unification of the many separate strands of netowkr analysis is the result of a great deal of integrative work by a number of individuals and institutions. There seem to have been eight ways in which various individuals and institutions acted as integrators: (1) Some moved from place to place and in so doing, bridged diverse collections of social network scholars. (2) Some produced computer programs that standardized the analysis of social network data. (3) Some organized conferenced designed explicitely to bring previously separate groups together. (4) One created an organization designed explicitely to link social network researchers worldwide. (5) One started a journal aimed at centering the literature in the field. (6) One arranged to use an early kind of internet to connect people doing social network analysis. (7) Working together, some established a series of regular annual meetings. (8) And finally, UCI, the Univeristy fo California Irvine, played a special role in unifying the social netowkr community" (pg 136)

I really liked the quote on page 166 about Barabasi, and how their finding wasn't actually that new.
