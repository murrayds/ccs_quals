#### Other Notes
----
I am interesed in fitting this work in with others that we have read. For one, Dr. Wajcman frames the car as a liberating force for women, whereas Cowan's *More work for Mother* instead frames it as a factor in women's continuing domestic labor. Wajcman also argues that online tools offer a way for social movements to form and mobilize, however this is at odds with Siva's *Antisocial Media* which argues what is nearly the opposite.
